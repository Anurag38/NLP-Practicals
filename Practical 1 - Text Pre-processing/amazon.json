["\n\n  Logitech in their infinite wisdom has dropped the unifying dongle from this product. Instead you get a single dongle that only works for this keyboard and mouse.

This download is 3 times the size of the old Set-Point software, and the first thing it does is ask you to create an account and to share your history! No Thank You!  Of course the \"Options\" software only controls the mouse, so if you want to map the keyboard, you still need to install the Set-Point package!  I uninstalled the \"Options\" package since this mouse is a very basic mouse and can be controlled with Microsoft generic options. The only function that you lose is the battery monitor.While I have always been a fan of Logitech products, this change from the unifying dongle and this keyboard in particular are changing my opinion. The keyboard has a pretty solid feel to it, but it constantly drops keystrokes. Since that is the primary function of a keyboard, I cannot recommend it. Also, the mouse that comes with this package feels really cheap (probably because it is cheap).  Those 2 problems combined make this package not a bargain.

In a review of a similar Logitech product, someone explained that they had the same issue but corrected it by placing the USB receiver within sight of the keyboard and mouse. So, I tried this and it has seemed to fix the issue. (I have my monitors on my desk with the keyboard & mouse, but everything is run through my laptop which I had stored under the desk. I moved the laptop to the top of my desk.)It's all working fine now, but I'm still only giving three stars because this is not ideal. I'll continue to use this for now, but will be replacing it in the near future so I can have my desk arranged the way I prefer it to be. Prospective buyers.. be aware that you will likely need your equipment arranged in a way that allows the USB receiver to be within sight of the mouse and keyboard (so if you have a computer tower that's stored under your desk and would be difficult to place elsewhere, you'll probably want to go with something different)\n\n", "\n\n  I have loved this keyboard.

It has been over 10 days now of waiting to get approval for warranty replacement (it supposedly has a 3 yr limited hardware warranty) and it does not seem to be coming anymore.

It's fairly basic, but I can still type quite high speed for my age.

So, I tried this and it has seemed to fix the issue. (I have my monitors on my desk with the keyboard & mouse, but everything is run through my laptop which I had stored under the desk. I moved the laptop to the top of my desk.)It's all working fine now, but I'm still only giving three stars because this is not ideal. I'll continue to use this for now, but will be replacing it in the near future so I can have my desk arranged the way I prefer it to be. Prospective buyers.. be aware that you will likely need your equipment arranged in a way that allows the USB receiver to be within sight of the mouse and keyboard (so if you have a computer tower that's stored under your desk and would be difficult to place elsewhere, you'll probably want to go with something different)\n\n", "\n\n  I have loved this keyboard. When the space bar, 7 key, ; and other keys ceased to function and is still in warranty, Logitech has me talk to multiple technicians, all of whom keep asking me to do the same tasks over again. I have talked with over 3 techs now and they have not read what I have done with the other technicians. It has been over 10 days now of waiting to get approval for warranty replacement (it supposedly has a 3 yr limited hardware warranty) and it does not seem to be coming anymore. They no longer respond to my emails. I have purchased many Logitech items over the years and thought they were a good company, but seeing this lack of honoring their warranty has made me rethink their products and customer service. I will now be referring most of my friends and coworkers elsewhere.\n\n", "\n\n  I already had one of these and am using it on my desktop with a dual computer setup.  Rather than take that apart every time I wanted to use my laptop with a standard keyboard, I just got a 2nd one.  The original one has been functioning flawlessly for years, with very few batteries ever used despite rarely being turned of.  So far, this newer item performs just as well.  It's fairly basic, but I can still type quite high speed for my age.  Just plug in the USB dongle, make sure you have appropriate charged batteries installed, and you've got a keyboard and mouse for almost any situation.  Great product at a decent price.  And the \"feel\" of the keys during typing is wonderful if you can touch-type.\n\n", "\n\n  User must install Logitech's control center package (download from Logitech).  But Mac OS Catalina has many security barriers and Logitech's code does not play nicely with those.  It wants access to all keystroke input, to the screen, and to the file system(!).  I tried to grant those but Logitech's documentation was out of data and I could find no way to grant the necessary screen/file permissions.  Also, installation requires several reboots of the Mac.Also, Logitech control center said \"no Logitech devices found\" despite fact that the mouse was working and the keyboard was sort of working (but things like caps lock, function keys, and other necessities did not work.)Mac OS Catalina works fine with wired USB mice and keyboards without need of any additional software.  It is odd that this product requires so much ancillary software (and even then, it doesn't work.)I gave up.  I will be returning this keyboard/mouse.\n\n", "\n\n  The USB Dongle is tucked inside of the battery compartment where it is hard to see and I thought it was missing.  Thankfully the customer care rep from Amazon knew right were the dongle was and when I looked a second time I noticed it.  What they should do is color the top of the dongle differently so it stands out for those with less than perfect vision like myself.  I am extremely technically proficient but I missed this little crucial part.  I forgot the Rep's name who helped me and resolved it in about 20 seconds on the phone but I appreciate competent customer service rep's like the fellow who helped me just now.  Thanks.  Otherwise you can't go wrong with Logitech keyboards and mice.  I have been using them for years for custom builds and wherever a wireless device can be used.  Sometimes in the business place you want your mice and keyboards to be wired so employee's don't loose them and render a work station useless.  But when you can use a wireless mouse and keyboard Logitech is dependable and nice.\n\n", "\n\n  I own the Logitech K120 keyboard. I actually think it's fantastic for the price. Fairly stiff keys and a comfortable layout. But I want to get rid of the cables, so I order the Logitech K270 since it's the exact same layout except wireless. Should be 100% passable, right?What a dreadful keyboard. The membrane is so soft it's like typing in a bowl of pudding. Works fine if a bit laggy at 2 feet but not at all at 3 feet. Let me demonstrate by typing literally 3 feet from my tower:This is tst keyWhich translates to \"This is the worst keyboard I have ever used,\" in 2 foot language. Maybe it's unfair since there's a desk and most of the tower in the way. TOO BAD. In rel world, this means a 2 foot range. \"Rel\" means \"real\" in 1 foot language apparently.Can't comment on durability. I may update if I decide to smash it out of frustration. No seriously, this is bad. And I've used Inland products. INLAND: the company that tries to make everything everyone else has ever made look good.The mouse--I was already planning on not using the mouse due to lack of side buttons and generally looked like a horrible user experience. Lived up to the every pessimistic guess about it's crappiness. Too small, too light, too slow. But then there's an extra kick in the pants. This does not sync with the Logitech Unified dongle. So if you can even tolerate this travesty of a keyboard but want a different mouse, you're going to need to use 2 dongles.I have a headache from using this product. Dear me, it's bad. So bad. Just don't buy it.\n\n", "\n\n  I saw several reviews saying usb was missing. Ive had ple ty of keyboards. Normally their in the mouse. I unboxed it, opened mouse and its not there. Great!  So i got in touch with amazon, start a replacement order. I went to re box the items and thats when infound it in the ear of the box lid. If u would have oepened the box at the other end i dont know that i would have ever seen it. Seems silly that they did this. But in case anyone else has this issue, check the tabs. Also, got for my son for schooling and playing games. Works great. Always been a good brand.\n\n", "\n\n  I needed a cheap wireless keyboard and mouse and this fit the bill perfectly. Small like I wanted but with the same great Logitech keyboard feel. I do like the215 mouse better as it's a bit bigger and fits my hand better, but for the purpose, this one is great. Plugged it in and it worked right off the bat with Windows 10. Third wireless keyboard and mouse on my desk and no interference between any of them.One slight issue, but I don't think it's the mouse. I plugged a San Disk 256gb stick in next to the receiver and the receiver got real jumpy on the mouse and the keyboard quit working totally. Used another USB stick drive and didn't have a problem. But if you hit that situation, be advised. Moved receiver to the back of the PC and problem solved.\n\n", "\n\n  I'm highly disappointed as the keyboard often doesn't work. The mouse is fine, but the keyboard will stop working for several minutes at a time. Then will type 1 of the previous letters or a jumble of the letters I was trying to type. Then it won't erase right away as I fight with it. Since I'm currently unable to sit at a desk and need a wireless keyboard I'm very frustrated. 2 stars because the mouse works but would have been only 1 star and a return otherwise. I can't get out to do a return as I can't walk or drive for several weeks. I expected so much better from Logitech as I've used their products for years.Update: Had this now 1 month. Downgrading to 1 star. Keyboard with fresh batteries and it still didn't type for the last 10 minutes. Tapping keys waiting for it to work. It finally typed 2 letters then stopped again. Total junk. I've ordered a keyboard extension cord for my regular keyboard and will be tossing this when it arrives. What a waste.Writing review using my phone.\n\n", "\n\n  Only giving this 3 stars, because the Keyboard is OK, but the mouse has lots of issues. One major issue is it lags bad. Not good for gaming or anything else. Even adjusted the settings in windows, and it still LAGS. Another issue is it's way too big for my hands, and I wear a large glove. Another issue is it just wasn't comfortable in my hand. Didn't like the feel at all. Oh ya some other things I didn't like... the driver software is worthless... it's just a way for Logitech to track who brought their product. Nothing special about it at all, you do not need it to make this product work. Also I realize that cost probably drove this issue, but the dongle is for both items instead of one for each.  Didn't like that. Still using the keyboard, but the mouse is in the trash where it belongs.\n\n", "\n\n  Overall, the Logitech K350 Keyboard is an \"okay\" keyboard. Unfortunately, its design requires a firmer pressure to activate the keys than my Microsoft 4000 Comfort Keyboard. I miss the softer touch of the Microsoft keyboard. But I'm getting used to the firmer pressure required on the Logitech keyboard. Unfortunately, the design of the Logitech K350 keyboard is puzzling. Some of the keyboard keys are recessed for the left hand and right hand. I assume that the design was to make it more comfortable. But I don't find that the design is more comfortable at all. Unfortunately, after a month of usage, I'm catching myself still glancing down at the keyboard to ensure my fingers are on the correct keys. Therefore, I still can't type as fast as I could with my previous keyboard. For these reasons, I'm only giving it a 4-star rating.\n\n", "\n\n  I have the exact same \"model\" of this keyboard and mouse set that I bought several years ago. It's lasted a long time, but my left mouse click button is starting to fail. The quality of this new set isn't even close to the quality of the same model version from a few years ago. The buttons on the keyboard on the new K350 are squishy and have almost no resistance to being pushed. Maybe you like that, but I don't. The old one has some satisfying \"clicks\" and some resistance to typing. The new M705 mouse is a joke compared to the old version. Again it weighs less than the older version making it feel cheaper. It's missing one of the buttons on the bottom side that was on the old version, and it has a much lower resolution than the older one making the new mouse pointer feel either extremely slow, or jumpy if you increase the speed.  One of the zoom buttons on my keyboard had the plastic part of the button there, but there was nothing underneath it, so it didn't even work. How this ever made it out of the factory is beyond me. Does no one check the quality there?  Then there's the fact that now you have to use some software called \"Logitech Options\" to configure the mouse instead of the older \"Logitech Setpoint\" which wouldn't be an issue except that neither program would find the keyboard -  even though like I already mentioned, is the exact same \"model\".  I don't know what's going on over there at Logitech, but if this is the quality of their stuff, I think this is probably my last time buying it.\n\n", "\n\n  Pros:  The wave keyboard layout is better for me than flat.The volume controls at the top of the keyboard make increasing/decreasing volume much easier than using the mouse.On the left side of the keyboard is a zoom in/out toggle which is VERY nice when I come across pages that have print too small for me to read.There is also a \"tab\" toggle that shows all open windows and a list of most recent activity.  Nice, but I have no use for it.The thumb rest is indented so my thumb no longer drags on the mouse pad.Cons:  Scrolling in game mode is erratic.There is a row of programmable function keys between the keyboard and volume control. I tried programming the calendar [F3] and email [F9] function keys, both to no avail.I use Google Calendar and the mouse seems to have a mind of its own, scrolling 3 months at a time as soon as I open it.There is a page forward/back above the the thumb rest that I have inadvertently touched because of their proximity to the thumb rest.Overall impression:  Too much money for too little performance.  I can not, in all good conscience, recommend this keyboard/mouse combination.  Disappointing since I am a long time fan of Logitech.\n\n", "\n\n  UPDATE: The M705 mouse has a button behind the scroll wheel you can push to change it from free wheeling with no restriction, to a more usable \u201cclicky\u201d scroll. The added weight of the wheel allows fast scrolling while the \u201cmode\u201d button prevents the wheel from randomly moving and scrolling on its own.In addition, I moved the USB receiver to different USB port and eliminated the jerkiness of the mouse.Because of that I am upgrading my stars to 4. This bundle is a comfortable and reliable mouse and keyboard.\u2014\u2014 original review \u2014\u2014The M705 mouse that is included in the MK570 bundle is terrible. It has one of those free spinning scroll wheels. I could've gotten used to the \"hyper fast\" scrolling that is possible. But, the scroll wheel is unbalanced. I can't get used to the unexpected scrolling the mouse does whenever the mouse is moved around or tapped on the desk. To top it off, there is regular lag on this mouse for some reason. Prior to this, I have run two MK550 bundles for a few years, and have been completely happy with it. I'll be sending this back for the MK550 with the M510 mouse. I've happy with the keyboard although this one has more \"click\" in the keys than my old one.\n\n", "\n\n  I own a Logitech k350, which I bought a few years ago. Over time the keys began sticking, but besides that, I really liked the product.  Last week I ordered a Logitech MK570, which looks EXACTLY like the k350, but of course, it is the latest model.  I received the product, unboxed it, and while I was inserting the batteries in the back, much to my surprise, Amazon had shipped me a K350 but had charged me for the MK570.  I looked at the box it came in and saw that they had shipped me a K350 in a MK 570 box. I thought it was a fluke.  So I called CS, they apologized,  and made arrangements for a replacement, which I received today.  I unboxed it and low and behold I received another K350 in MK570 packaging.  I don't really write a lot of negative reviews, but I can't help but think that in today's profit-minded world and with no conscience or moral compass, that Logitec and Amazon are packing and shipping thousands of surplus K350s in MK570 clothing, at the MK570 price, betting that there is a large percentage of buyers who would never notice the difference because the two models look exactly alike.  So this is YOUR warning, BUYER BEWARE!!!  Check your product when you receive it to make sure you got what you paid for, cause chances are you didn't.\n\n", "\n\n  I used to be a big fan of Logitech, not anymore.  I realized that the mouse in this combo pack was a cheap pile of crap right out of the box, but I thought the keyboard was at least tolerable.  The whole keyboard is warped, and no I'm not talking about the \"wave\" feature, I'm talking about what's supposed to be a flat bottom that sits on your desk.  Only the feet at each end touch the desk, the warping prevents the middle feet from touching the desk until you press down with enough force to make them touch.  I put up with that flaw, but now after using it for only a few months, both the \"Ctrl\" key and the \"Alt\" key have become intermittent, I have to press down on them, wriggle them around, and look for some indication on screen that they have actually engaged.  Bottom line is, this keyboard and mouse combo is the biggest pile of crap I've ever seen, and it's turned me from a Logitech fan to a Logitech hater.\n\n", "\n\n  Purchased this because I had issues with a \"cool\" wireless keyboard/mouse combo - one of the super slim and stylish sets. It looked cool, but started failing after two months of working at home.I went back to the keyboard and mouse brand I've been gaming on for two decades and got this for my work from home setup. Typing is far more comfortable, and the mouse is much more accurate and responsive. Zero regrets, should've just gotten this to begin with.One slight issue though - when unboxing, I could not find the USB adapter to save my life. After tearing apart the box, it fell out onto the floor. I'm assuming this was a one-off but I never saw it in the package till I tore it apart.

It is also an older model keyboard compared to the newer model mouse included, and required downloading two different programs from Logitech's website in order to program the customization features for each.  In addition, sometimes the mouse features will stop working and requires me to go back in and reset them.The mouse is also a newer, modified version of the original M705 mouse.

This bundle is a comfortable and reliable mouse and keyboard.\u2014\u2014 original review \u2014\u2014The M705 mouse that is included in the MK570 bundle is terrible. It has one of those free spinning scroll wheels. I could've gotten used to the \"hyper fast\" scrolling that is possible. But, the scroll wheel is unbalanced. I can't get used to the unexpected scrolling the mouse does whenever the mouse is moved around or tapped on the desk. To top it off, there is regular lag on this mouse for some reason. Prior to this, I have run two MK550 bundles for a few years, and have been completely happy with it. I'll be sending this back for the MK550 with the M510 mouse. I've happy with the keyboard although this one has more \"click\" in the keys than my old one.\n\n", "\n\n  I own a Logitech k350, which I bought a few years ago. Over time the keys began sticking, but besides that, I really liked the product.  Last week I ordered a Logitech MK570, which looks EXACTLY like the k350, but of course, it is the latest model.  I received the product, unboxed it, and while I was inserting the batteries in the back, much to my surprise, Amazon had shipped me a K350 but had charged me for the MK570.  I looked at the box it came in and saw that they had shipped me a K350 in a MK 570 box. I thought it was a fluke.  So I called CS, they apologized,  and made arrangements for a replacement, which I received today.  I unboxed it and low and behold I received another K350 in MK570 packaging.  I don't really write a lot of negative reviews, but I can't help but think that in today's profit-minded world and with no conscience or moral compass, that Logitec and Amazon are packing and shipping thousands of surplus K350s in MK570 clothing, at the MK570 price, betting that there is a large percentage of buyers who would never notice the difference because the two models look exactly alike.  So this is YOUR warning, BUYER BEWARE!!!  Check your product when you receive it to make sure you got what you paid for, cause chances are you didn't.\n\n", "\n\n  I used to be a big fan of Logitech, not anymore.  I realized that the mouse in this combo pack was a cheap pile of crap right out of the box, but I thought the keyboard was at least tolerable.  The whole keyboard is warped, and no I'm not talking about the \"wave\" feature, I'm talking about what's supposed to be a flat bottom that sits on your desk.  Only the feet at each end touch the desk, the warping prevents the middle feet from touching the desk until you press down with enough force to make them touch.  I put up with that flaw, but now after using it for only a few months, both the \"Ctrl\" key and the \"Alt\" key have become intermittent, I have to press down on them, wriggle them around, and look for some indication on screen that they have actually engaged.  Bottom line is, this keyboard and mouse combo is the biggest pile of crap I've ever seen, and it's turned me from a Logitech fan to a Logitech hater.\n\n", "\n\n  Purchased this because I had issues with a \"cool\" wireless keyboard/mouse combo - one of the super slim and stylish sets. It looked cool, but started failing after two months of working at home.I went back to the keyboard and mouse brand I've been gaming on for two decades and got this for my work from home setup. Typing is far more comfortable, and the mouse is much more accurate and responsive. Zero regrets, should've just gotten this to begin with.One slight issue though - when unboxing, I could not find the USB adapter to save my life. After tearing apart the box, it fell out onto the floor. I'm assuming this was a one-off but I never saw it in the package till I tore it apart. Be careful when opening it!\n\n", "\n\n  I wish I had done more research on wireless Logitech products and just bought a keyboard and mouse separately that were both \"unifying receiver capable\".Upon first glance this setup is quite nice, but they keyboard feels a bit cheap and bulky upon use. The ergonomic curves seem to be more of a marketing gimmick than anything. It is also an older model keyboard compared to the newer model mouse included, and required downloading two different programs from Logitech's website in order to program the customization features for each.  In addition, sometimes the mouse features will stop working and requires me to go back in and reset them.The mouse is also a newer, modified version of the original M705 mouse.  Research shows me that reviewers claim the original version to be far superior than the one included in this bundle.\n\n", "\n\n  I purchased this the end of November because I love this keyboard, but the letters wore of the previous version of this, I purchased this one, hoping it would last at least a year, it's 6 weeks and the E, S , D and N are almost gone.  Do not buy unless you don't care about the letters missing from your Keyboard.\n\n", "\n\n  Only giving this 3 stars, because the Keyboard is OK, but the mouse has lots of issues. One major issue is it lags bad. Not good for gaming or anything else. Even adjusted the settings in windows, and it still LAGS. Another issue is it's way too big for my hands, and I wear a large glove. Another issue is it just wasn't comfortable in my hand. Didn't like the feel at all. Oh ya some other things I didn't like... the driver software is worthless... it's just a way for Logitech to track who brought their product. Nothing special about it at all, you do not need it to make this product work. Also I realize that cost probably drove this issue, but the dongle is for both items instead of one for each.  Didn't like that. Still using the keyboard, but the mouse is in the trash where it belongs.\n\n", "\n\n  Overall, the Logitech K350 Keyboard is an \"okay\" keyboard. Unfortunately, its design requires a firmer pressure to activate the keys than my Microsoft 4000 Comfort Keyboard. I miss the softer touch of the Microsoft keyboard. But I'm getting used to the firmer pressure required on the Logitech keyboard. Unfortunately, the design of the Logitech K350 keyboard is puzzling. Some of the keyboard keys are recessed for the left hand and right hand. I assume that the design was to make it more comfortable. But I don't find that the design is more comfortable at all. Unfortunately, after a month of usage, I'm catching myself still glancing down at the keyboard to ensure my fingers are on the correct keys. Therefore, I still can't type as fast as I could with my previous keyboard. For these reasons, I'm only giving it a 4-star rating.\n\n", "\n\n  I have the exact same \"model\" of this keyboard and mouse set that I bought several years ago. It's lasted a long time, but my left mouse click button is starting to fail. The quality of this new set isn't even close to the quality of the same model version from a few years ago. The buttons on the keyboard on the new K350 are squishy and have almost no resistance to being pushed. Maybe you like that, but I don't. The old one has some satisfying \"clicks\" and some resistance to typing. The new M705 mouse is a joke compared to the old version. Again it weighs less than the older version making it feel cheaper. It's missing one of the buttons on the bottom side that was on the old version, and it has a much lower resolution than the older one making the new mouse pointer feel either extremely slow, or jumpy if you increase the speed.  One of the zoom buttons on my keyboard had the plastic part of the button there, but there was nothing underneath it, so it didn't even work. How this ever made it out of the factory is beyond me. Does no one check the quality there?  Then there's the fact that now you have to use some software called \"Logitech Options\" to configure the mouse instead of the older \"Logitech Setpoint\" which wouldn't be an issue except that neither program would find the keyboard -  even though like I already mentioned, is the exact same \"model\".  I don't know what's going on over there at Logitech, but if this is the quality of their stuff, I think this is probably my last time buying it.\n\n", "\n\n  Pros:  The wave keyboard layout is better for me than flat.The volume controls at the top of the keyboard make increasing/decreasing volume much easier than using the mouse.On the left side of the keyboard is a zoom in/out toggle which is VERY nice when I come across pages that have print too small for me to read.There is also a \"tab\" toggle that shows all open windows and a list of most recent activity.  Nice, but I have no use for it.The thumb rest is indented so my thumb no longer drags on the mouse pad.Cons:  Scrolling in game mode is erratic.There is a row of programmable function keys between the keyboard and volume control. I tried programming the calendar [F3] and email [F9] function keys, both to no avail.I use Google Calendar and the mouse seems to have a mind of its own, scrolling 3 months at a time as soon as I open it.There is a page forward/back above the the thumb rest that I have inadvertently touched because of their proximity to the thumb rest.Overall impression:  Too much money for too little performance.  I can not, in all good conscience, recommend this keyboard/mouse combination.

In that regard, it is quite good.Right from the outset I was very impressed with it's no-hassle plug and play aspect. I literally removed it from the box (batteries came already installed), plugged the tiny nano-receiver into a USB port on the old laptop that I happened to have handy at the time (a 7 year old machine running Windows Vista) and both the keyboard and mouse were recognized and responsive in under 30 seconds. From box to working in a minute or two. That is probably record time for any computer accessory that I've ever installed.\u27a4'TIP: While this is plug-and-play and works perfectly without installing any drivers or software, you can get some added functionality if you install Logitech's Setpoint software. I have provided the link for it on the bottom of this review.'\u27a4IMPORTANT  NOTE: Many people comment that the mouse is small. This is partially an ILLUSION due to the SHAPE of the mouse, which is a bit different from others. If you see my comparison photos, you will see that it is not much smaller than other mice.I used two standard size mice and one very small travel mouse for comparison. Some people have also commented on the light weight of the mouse. This is actually true as it is in fact relatively light:Here are my weight comparisons (without/with batteries):Included Mouse (M275)-63g/86g  VX Revolution (M-RBU126)- 83g/110g  Marathon (M705)-87g/135gVX Nano (M-RC134)-73/95gFIRST IMPRESSION (Overall): Both the keyboard and the mouse are fairly light. There is protective plastic on the keyboard which once removed reveals an attractive glossy surface around the key portion of it. The palm rest has a flat rather than glossy finish and has small indentations which give it some very subtle texture. The mouse has a very narrow wraparound glossy collar (also covered with protective plastic). The sides (indentation for thumb and opposite side) have the same flat sheen and textured design as on the keyboard's palm-rest. The result is a sort of two-toned black on black look. Aesthetically, the mouse and keyboard co-ordinate very well.MOUSE: This is quite obviously a right-handed mouse. Some might consider the mouse to be on the SMALLER side. This is really a MATTER OF PREFERENCE and as I already noted, this is largely an illusion. I have used both larger and smaller mice and sometimes it is just a matter of what you are accustomed to. I usually prefer the smaller mice because they seem easier to maneuver around with subtle finger movements. It has an overall ergonomic shape that feels pretty comfortable and natural in my own medium-sized hand. I can understand those with bigger hands preferring something a little more substantial. This is a great mouse to use with a laptop (or as a dual-use travel/stationary mouse), especially since it works with the nano receiver and has the small look.This is a no-frills mouse. It has the basic left and right click button and wheel. It does not have any extra buttons that you find on some other mice that are usually programmed to move forwards or backwards through web pages, zoom, etc. The wheel does have a push button. When depressed, it puts the mouse into a 4-way scroll mode, that is you can scroll in four directions around a page by moving the mouse as you would normally move the cursor. Depress again to return to cursor control. It is made of a rubber-like material which gives it a nice feel.The mouse seems responsive and I have not had any issues with losing connectivity so far.KEYBOARD: Normal full-sized keyboard. There is an on/off switch and an LED Caps Lock indicator. The \"Function\" and \"Control\" keys might be a little larger than on other keyboards (especially the Function key) and it seems like the space bar was made a little smaller to accommodate this. I have not found it to be a problem for me, but felt I should note it any way. There are the typical flip-out feet to set the keyboard on an angle. The palm-rest is angled nicely and feels a comfortable size, not too obtrusive nor too diminutive. The keys feel soft when pressed and are fairly quiet. Logitech claims this to be a spill-resistant design. I have not tested this out yet, but if you knew me, you'd know that I will be able to report on this feature fairly soon.There is a full range of function keys across the top with default shortcut/media keys displayed as icons (Home, Mail, Search, Calculator, Media Player, Previous, Play/Pause, Next, Mute, Decrease Volume, Increase Volume). You need to download the Setpoint software from Logitech's website for these to work properly and the way that you want them to.BATTERY LIFE: Logitech claims that this combo has \"Advanced energy-efficient design\" which should yield a very generous battery life of 3 years for the keyboard and 18 months for the mouse. Of course there is no way to prove or disprove this just yet.IN CONCLUSION: I will say again that this is good basic or starter combo. If you are in the market for such for yourself or someone else, I don't think that you can go wrong with this. The main point should be making sure that the user will be comfortable with a smaller rather than more substantial mouse (at the risk of sounding sexist I will go out on a limb and say that this mouse is probably perfectly suited for many female users). If it is for someone who is not a gamer/cutting edge/latest gadget type of a person who just needs the best of the basics without a lot of extras, than this might just be perfect.It is also a good choice if you need something fairly portable or for occasional use with a laptop.Link to Download Setpoint Software from Logitech to customize the keyboard:(Amazon does not enable direct links, so you need to copy and paste)http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/wireless-combo-mk345#downloadQuestions/Comments welcome.\n\n", "\n\n  This is meant for a low-use office computer and has served its purpose quite well thus far. I've read the negative comments and I think I can help clear your mind. Yes, the mouse is relatively small - not a dealbreaker if you've got: smaller hands, normal sized hands, or use the computer in question infrequently. Know what else is small? The USB dongle associated with this! Which makes it a breeze to swap between computers, like in my case a desktop/latptop. Paired instantly, keyboard/mouse had a good response rate off the bat on both my Macbook and PC desktop. This is a simple middle of the road wireless combo set. I would recommend for casual users. Obviously not for gamers or hardcore office desk warriors. If you're in the sweet spot, do yourself a favor spend up a little bit and get a reliable setup like this from a reliable company like logitech.\n\n", "\n\n  I love this keyboard/mouse combo.  It was super easy to install. I just plugged it in & my laptop automatically recognized the devices. All I had to do was pulled out the battery tabs & I was set.The keyboard has back tabs that when opened, tilt the keyboard by 7\u00b0.  The keys are not flat by raised in a traditional keyboard fashion which I prefer for touch typing.  The keys are easy to press. It\u2019s quiet enough but when I really get into typing, you can really hear the tapping of the keys which might be annoying for the people around in a quiet office but it doesn\u2019t sound any different from other keyboards of this type. I find the keyboards with the flatter keys to be much quieter.  The palm rest is made of a hard plastic but it is comfortable against the bottom of your palm while typing.The mouse ergonomically fits in the palm nicely and works smoothly in my desktop (both my computer desktop & my actual desktop).  I think this package set was a fantastic deal!\n\n", "\n\n  I bought this keyboard for my office after our Dell wireless keyboard & mouse combos they got us every bit of 7 years ago finally wore out. Being used to the wireless keyboard & mouse, nothing Logitech makes has met my expectations. This is the second keyboard of theirs I have tried. I often type and nothing happens, despite brand new batteries. It also seems to lag and duplicate keys when I'm typing. This keyboard was delivered to me on 4/1/19 and today it is 8/29/19 and I have reached the end of my rope. I started having issues about a month in. I've replaced the batteries at least 2 times in 4 months. When it just decides it doesn't want to type, sometimes it only lasts 3 seconds, sometimes it won't work for minutes. I turn it off, wait and turn it on again. Sometimes it will type right away after that, and sometimes it doesn't. Hitting it on something seems to fix the issue immediately each time, except that I've now lost the battery compartment cover, keys, and my space bar flew off and now it sticks.Don't even buy this if you type often and expect it to work when you need it to.\n\n", "\n\n  This Model 345 (~$26) fail after two months while still on warranty.  You choose to replace it with a lesser Model 320 (~$22).  Why not go to the next higher model if the 345 was no longer being sold? The 320 has an inferior mouse and keyboard with no palm rest.  Why go cheap when your product fails.  Less than stellar customer service to remedy the problem took almost three weeks to figure out how to return/replace the product.  Finally, the serial number was located behind the battery access cover.\n\nLogitech MK345 Wireless Combo - Full-sized Keyboard with Palm Rest and Comfortable Right-Handed Mouse", "\n\n  This is a basic (\"no frills\") keyboard-mouse combo that works fine. I got it after having problems with another Logitech combo (MK850) where the mouse had severe scrolling problems. But, this one works perfectly.One problem that many reviewers discovered (including myself) is the erratic behavior of the keyboard. It will suddenly lag behind what you are typing before showing up on the monitor and even skip keys. I did some searching on the Internet and found a HP document that discussed the problem. Apparently, it is due to interference by USB 3.0 devices and ports on USB 2.0 devices, which is what the dongle for this keyboard-mouse combo operates on. Here is a paragraph from that document (Amazon prevents me listing the URL):\"This is a known industry wide issue that occurs when the USB 2.0 transceiver is located in close proximity to a USB 3.0 port, cable, or device - for more information please reference the white paper below. The issue is due to radio interference with the USB 2.0 devices by USB 3.0 ports, cables, or devices. This most commonly occurs with wireless keyboard/mouse/dongle kits when an external HDD device is in use, but can occur with any type of USB 2.0 wireless device and USB 3.0 port, cable, or device.\"HP recommends that you create as much separation between the dongle and any USB 3.0 devices/ports. What I did was put the dongle in one of the USB ports on my monitor and the problem immediately disappeared. I have been testing it for a few days and the keyboard is now perfectly stable.In any case, this combo works fine. I don't know how it would respond to gaming (I'm not a gamer) but for ordinary computer use, it's great.\n\n", "\n\n  FYI This keyboard is NOT compatible with unifying receivers (aka you cannot pair it with other Logitech unifying products like the MX Master mouse). When trying to pair in the unifying receiver you get an error. The only way around it is to use TWO USB receivers which is not practical at all when on a laptop with limited USB ports. Another way to tell that this is the case is comparing the receivers. The combo receiver is black and generic with no unifying logo on it (on the left), whereas the unifying receiver (on the right) includes the orange unifying logo.The frustrating part is Logitech is not clear upfront about this. Now I have to waste time boxing it back up and returning it. If Logitech would be clear about this on the description I would have just found the correct pair that is compatible.\n\n", "\n\n  I was skeptical about trying out this keyboard, mostly because it has 1000 less reviews than most other keyboards in the same price range. My personal reasons for picking this up (other than the reasonably low price) was the need for a wireless keyboard with a \"full keyboard\" feel. The keys are quite large and although there's not much feedback it feels closer to a real keyboard than others I have tried. My biggest knock is the way the F keys are laid out. I'm so used to having a space between every 4 F keys but I was aware of this at the time of purchase (to the point where it was almost a dealbreaker for me) and took a chance on it anyways.The mouse is rather small and this might put some people off. But the mouse itself is a high quality mouse, so that makes up for the size in my book. A lot of online reviews show the bottom of the keyboard as blue, mine came in black (and so did the mouse).One other thing that stood out is the leg stands for height adjustment, they were quite higher than I'm used to and there is no in between. I've had keyboards in the past that have two different tabs for different height measurements but this only had one size. At first it seemed to wobble a bit, and it felt quite high, but after use for a few minutes it felt just right.Again, my biggest knock on this keyboard is the setup of the F keys and the fact that there is no space in between them, so you either have to know where the key is or take a second to look and see what key you're pressing. I would have liked perhaps a small marking (like the ones on the F and J keys) to indicate every fourth F key, that way I can identify the key just by touching it and kind of get my bearings without having to look down. This gets especially difficult in the dark as the keyboard is not lit at all.On a final note, the num lock key not having a lighting indicator isn't much of a problem for me but it is a thing, but it's a minor inconvenience for me, so I don't really see it as a major flaw or a problem.\n\n", "\n\n  I very nearly gave this wireless keyboard/mouse a one star rating and a lousy review.

Some people have also commented on the light weight of the mouse. This is actually true as it is in fact relatively light:Here are my weight comparisons (without/with batteries):Included Mouse (M275)-63g/86g  VX Revolution (M-RBU126)- 83g/110g  Marathon (M705)-87g/135gVX Nano (M-RC134)-73/95gFIRST IMPRESSION (Overall): Both the keyboard and the mouse are fairly light. There is protective plastic on the keyboard which once removed reveals an attractive glossy surface around the key portion of it. The palm rest has a flat rather than glossy finish and has small indentations which give it some very subtle texture. The mouse has a very narrow wraparound glossy collar (also covered with protective plastic). The sides (indentation for thumb and opposite side) have the same flat sheen and textured design as on the keyboard's palm-rest. The result is a sort of two-toned black on black look. Aesthetically, the mouse and keyboard co-ordinate very well.MOUSE: This is quite obviously a right-handed mouse. Some might consider the mouse to be on the SMALLER side. This is really a MATTER OF PREFERENCE and as I already noted, this is largely an illusion. I have used both larger and smaller mice and sometimes it is just a matter of what you are accustomed to. I usually prefer the smaller mice because they seem easier to maneuver around with subtle finger movements. It has an overall ergonomic shape that feels pretty comfortable and natural in my own medium-sized hand. I can understand those with bigger hands preferring something a little more substantial. This is a great mouse to use with a laptop (or as a dual-use travel/stationary mouse), especially since it works with the nano receiver and has the small look.This is a no-frills mouse. It has the basic left and right click button and wheel. It does not have any extra buttons that you find on some other mice that are usually programmed to move forwards or backwards through web pages, zoom, etc. The wheel does have a push button. When depressed, it puts the mouse into a 4-way scroll mode, that is you can scroll in four directions around a page by moving the mouse as you would normally move the cursor. Depress again to return to cursor control. It is made of a rubber-like material which gives it a nice feel.The mouse seems responsive and I have not had any issues with losing connectivity so far.KEYBOARD: Normal full-sized keyboard. There is an on/off switch and an LED Caps Lock indicator. The \"Function\" and \"Control\" keys might be a little larger than on other keyboards (especially the Function key) and it seems like the space bar was made a little smaller to accommodate this. I have not found it to be a problem for me, but felt I should note it any way. There are the typical flip-out feet to set the keyboard on an angle. The palm-rest is angled nicely and feels a comfortable size, not too obtrusive nor too diminutive. The keys feel soft when pressed and are fairly quiet. Logitech claims this to be a spill-resistant design. I have not tested this out yet, but if you knew me, you'd know that I will be able to report on this feature fairly soon.There is a full range of function keys across the top with default shortcut/media keys displayed as icons (Home, Mail, Search, Calculator, Media Player, Previous, Play/Pause, Next, Mute, Decrease Volume, Increase Volume). You need to download the Setpoint software from Logitech's website for these to work properly and the way that you want them to.BATTERY LIFE: Logitech claims that this combo has \"Advanced energy-efficient design\" which should yield a very generous battery life of 3 years for the keyboard and 18 months for the mouse. Of course there is no way to prove or disprove this just yet.IN CONCLUSION: I will say again that this is good basic or starter combo. If you are in the market for such for yourself or someone else, I don't think that you can go wrong with this. The main point should be making sure that the user will be comfortable with a smaller rather than more substantial mouse (at the risk of sounding sexist I will go out on a limb and say that this mouse is probably perfectly suited for many female users). If it is for someone who is not a gamer/cutting edge/latest gadget type of a person who just needs the best of the basics without a lot of extras, than this might just be perfect.It is also a good choice if you need something fairly portable or for occasional use with a laptop.Link to Download Setpoint Software from Logitech to customize the keyboard:(Amazon does not enable direct links, so you need to copy and paste)http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/wireless-combo-mk345#downloadQuestions/Comments welcome.\n\n", "\n\n  This is meant for a low-use office computer and has served its purpose quite well thus far.

I got it after having problems with another Logitech combo (MK850) where the mouse had severe scrolling problems. But, this one works perfectly.One problem that many reviewers discovered (including myself) is the erratic behavior of the keyboard. It will suddenly lag behind what you are typing before showing up on the monitor and even skip keys. I did some searching on the Internet and found a HP document that discussed the problem. Apparently, it is due to interference by USB 3.0 devices and ports on USB 2.0 devices, which is what the dongle for this keyboard-mouse combo operates on. Here is a paragraph from that document (Amazon prevents me listing the URL):\"This is a known industry wide issue that occurs when the USB 2.0 transceiver is located in close proximity to a USB 3.0 port, cable, or device - for more information please reference the white paper below. The issue is due to radio interference with the USB 2.0 devices by USB 3.0 ports, cables, or devices. This most commonly occurs with wireless keyboard/mouse/dongle kits when an external HDD device is in use, but can occur with any type of USB 2.0 wireless device and USB 3.0 port, cable, or device.\"HP recommends that you create as much separation between the dongle and any USB 3.0 devices/ports. What I did was put the dongle in one of the USB ports on my monitor and the problem immediately disappeared. I have been testing it for a few days and the keyboard is now perfectly stable.In any case, this combo works fine.

When trying to pair in the unifying receiver you get an error. The only way around it is to use TWO USB receivers which is not practical at all when on a laptop with limited USB ports. Another way to tell that this is the case is comparing the receivers. The combo receiver is black and generic with no unifying logo on it (on the left), whereas the unifying receiver (on the right) includes the orange unifying logo.The frustrating part is Logitech is not clear upfront about this. Now I have to waste time boxing it back up and returning it. If Logitech would be clear about this on the description I would have just found the correct pair that is compatible.\n\n", "\n\n  I was skeptical about trying out this keyboard, mostly because it has 1000 less reviews than most other keyboards in the same price range. My personal reasons for picking this up (other than the reasonably low price) was the need for a wireless keyboard with a \"full keyboard\" feel. The keys are quite large and although there's not much feedback it feels closer to a real keyboard than others I have tried. My biggest knock is the way the F keys are laid out. I'm so used to having a space between every 4 F keys but I was aware of this at the time of purchase (to the point where it was almost a dealbreaker for me) and took a chance on it anyways.The mouse is rather small and this might put some people off. But the mouse itself is a high quality mouse, so that makes up for the size in my book. A lot of online reviews show the bottom of the keyboard as blue, mine came in black (and so did the mouse).One other thing that stood out is the leg stands for height adjustment, they were quite higher than I'm used to and there is no in between. I've had keyboards in the past that have two different tabs for different height measurements but this only had one size. At first it seemed to wobble a bit, and it felt quite high, but after use for a few minutes it felt just right.Again, my biggest knock on this keyboard is the setup of the F keys and the fact that there is no space in between them, so you either have to know where the key is or take a second to look and see what key you're pressing. I would have liked perhaps a small marking (like the ones on the F and J keys) to indicate every fourth F key, that way I can identify the key just by touching it and kind of get my bearings without having to look down. This gets especially difficult in the dark as the keyboard is not lit at all.On a final note, the num lock key not having a lighting indicator isn't much of a problem for me but it is a thing, but it's a minor inconvenience for me, so I don't really see it as a major flaw or a problem.\n\n", "\n\n  I very nearly gave this wireless keyboard/mouse a one star rating and a lousy review.

They both worked flawlessly.  -  This was not a practical solution though as I didn't want to use up one of my front USB ports, so I added a USB extension cable to the rear USB port I was using; plugged the dongle into that and then positioned the dongle in line of sight of the keyboard and mouse but in an unobtrusive location.

The palm-rest is angled nicely and feels a comfortable size, not too obtrusive nor too diminutive. The keys feel soft when pressed and are fairly quiet. Logitech claims this to be a spill-resistant design. I have not tested this out yet, but if you knew me, you'd know that I will be able to report on this feature fairly soon.There is a full range of function keys across the top with default shortcut/media keys displayed as icons (Home, Mail, Search, Calculator, Media Player, Previous, Play/Pause, Next, Mute, Decrease Volume, Increase Volume). You need to download the Setpoint software from Logitech's website for these to work properly and the way that you want them to.BATTERY LIFE: Logitech claims that this combo has \"Advanced energy-efficient design\" which should yield a very generous battery life of 3 years for the keyboard and 18 months for the mouse. Of course there is no way to prove or disprove this just yet.IN CONCLUSION: I will say again that this is good basic or starter combo. If you are in the market for such for yourself or someone else, I don't think that you can go wrong with this. The main point should be making sure that the user will be comfortable with a smaller rather than more substantial mouse (at the risk of sounding sexist I will go out on a limb and say that this mouse is probably perfectly suited for many female users). If it is for someone who is not a gamer/cutting edge/latest gadget type of a person who just needs the best of the basics without a lot of extras, than this might just be perfect.It is also a good choice if you need something fairly portable or for occasional use with a laptop.Link to Download Setpoint Software from Logitech to customize the keyboard:(Amazon does not enable direct links, so you need to copy and paste)http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/wireless-combo-mk345#downloadQuestions/Comments welcome.\n\n", "\n\n  This is meant for a low-use office computer and has served its purpose quite well thus far. I've read the negative comments and I think I can help clear your mind. Yes, the mouse is relatively small - not a dealbreaker if you've got: smaller hands, normal sized hands, or use the computer in question infrequently. Know what else is small? The USB dongle associated with this! Which makes it a breeze to swap between computers, like in my case a desktop/latptop. Paired instantly, keyboard/mouse had a good response rate off the bat on both my Macbook and PC desktop. This is a simple middle of the road wireless combo set. I would recommend for casual users. Obviously not for gamers or hardcore office desk warriors. If you're in the sweet spot, do yourself a favor spend up a little bit and get a reliable setup like this from a reliable company like logitech.\n\n", "\n\n  I love this keyboard/mouse combo.  It was super easy to install. I just plugged it in & my laptop automatically recognized the devices. All I had to do was pulled out the battery tabs & I was set.The keyboard has back tabs that when opened, tilt the keyboard by 7\u00b0.  The keys are not flat by raised in a traditional keyboard fashion which I prefer for touch typing.  The keys are easy to press. It\u2019s quiet enough but when I really get into typing, you can really hear the tapping of the keys which might be annoying for the people around in a quiet office but it doesn\u2019t sound any different from other keyboards of this type. I find the keyboards with the flatter keys to be much quieter.  The palm rest is made of a hard plastic but it is comfortable against the bottom of your palm while typing.The mouse ergonomically fits in the palm nicely and works smoothly in my desktop (both my computer desktop & my actual desktop).  I think this package set was a fantastic deal!\n\n", "\n\n  I bought this keyboard for my office after our Dell wireless keyboard & mouse combos they got us every bit of 7 years ago finally wore out. Being used to the wireless keyboard & mouse, nothing Logitech makes has met my expectations. This is the second keyboard of theirs I have tried. I often type and nothing happens, despite brand new batteries. It also seems to lag and duplicate keys when I'm typing. This keyboard was delivered to me on 4/1/19 and today it is 8/29/19 and I have reached the end of my rope. I started having issues about a month in. I've replaced the batteries at least 2 times in 4 months. When it just decides it doesn't want to type, sometimes it only lasts 3 seconds, sometimes it won't work for minutes. I turn it off, wait and turn it on again. Sometimes it will type right away after that, and sometimes it doesn't. Hitting it on something seems to fix the issue immediately each time, except that I've now lost the battery compartment cover, keys, and my space bar flew off and now it sticks.Don't even buy this if you type often and expect it to work when you need it to.\n\n", "\n\n  This Model 345 (~$26) fail after two months while still on warranty.  You choose to replace it with a lesser Model 320 (~$22).  Why not go to the next higher model if the 345 was no longer being sold? The 320 has an inferior mouse and keyboard with no palm rest.  Why go cheap when your product fails.  Less than stellar customer service to remedy the problem took almost three weeks to figure out how to return/replace the product.  Finally, the serial number was located behind the battery access cover.\n\nLogitech MK345 Wireless Combo - Full-sized Keyboard with Palm Rest and Comfortable Right-Handed Mouse", "\n\n  This is a basic (\"no frills\") keyboard-mouse combo that works fine. I got it after having problems with another Logitech combo (MK850) where the mouse had severe scrolling problems. But, this one works perfectly.One problem that many reviewers discovered (including myself) is the erratic behavior of the keyboard. It will suddenly lag behind what you are typing before showing up on the monitor and even skip keys. I did some searching on the Internet and found a HP document that discussed the problem. Apparently, it is due to interference by USB 3.0 devices and ports on USB 2.0 devices, which is what the dongle for this keyboard-mouse combo operates on. Here is a paragraph from that document (Amazon prevents me listing the URL):\"This is a known industry wide issue that occurs when the USB 2.0 transceiver is located in close proximity to a USB 3.0 port, cable, or device - for more information please reference the white paper below. The issue is due to radio interference with the USB 2.0 devices by USB 3.0 ports, cables, or devices. This most commonly occurs with wireless keyboard/mouse/dongle kits when an external HDD device is in use, but can occur with any type of USB 2.0 wireless device and USB 3.0 port, cable, or device.\"HP recommends that you create as much separation between the dongle and any USB 3.0 devices/ports. What I did was put the dongle in one of the USB ports on my monitor and the problem immediately disappeared. I have been testing it for a few days and the keyboard is now perfectly stable.In any case, this combo works fine. I don't know how it would respond to gaming (I'm not a gamer) but for ordinary computer use, it's great.\n\n", "\n\n  FYI This keyboard is NOT compatible with unifying receivers (aka you cannot pair it with other Logitech unifying products like the MX Master mouse). When trying to pair in the unifying receiver you get an error. The only way around it is to use TWO USB receivers which is not practical at all when on a laptop with limited USB ports. Another way to tell that this is the case is comparing the receivers. The combo receiver is black and generic with no unifying logo on it (on the left), whereas the unifying receiver (on the right) includes the orange unifying logo.The frustrating part is Logitech is not clear upfront about this. Now I have to waste time boxing it back up and returning it. If Logitech would be clear about this on the description I would have just found the correct pair that is compatible.\n\n", "\n\n  I was skeptical about trying out this keyboard, mostly because it has 1000 less reviews than most other keyboards in the same price range. My personal reasons for picking this up (other than the reasonably low price) was the need for a wireless keyboard with a \"full keyboard\" feel. The keys are quite large and although there's not much feedback it feels closer to a real keyboard than others I have tried. My biggest knock is the way the F keys are laid out. I'm so used to having a space between every 4 F keys but I was aware of this at the time of purchase (to the point where it was almost a dealbreaker for me) and took a chance on it anyways.The mouse is rather small and this might put some people off. But the mouse itself is a high quality mouse, so that makes up for the size in my book. A lot of online reviews show the bottom of the keyboard as blue, mine came in black (and so did the mouse).One other thing that stood out is the leg stands for height adjustment, they were quite higher than I'm used to and there is no in between. I've had keyboards in the past that have two different tabs for different height measurements but this only had one size. At first it seemed to wobble a bit, and it felt quite high, but after use for a few minutes it felt just right.Again, my biggest knock on this keyboard is the setup of the F keys and the fact that there is no space in between them, so you either have to know where the key is or take a second to look and see what key you're pressing. I would have liked perhaps a small marking (like the ones on the F and J keys) to indicate every fourth F key, that way I can identify the key just by touching it and kind of get my bearings without having to look down. This gets especially difficult in the dark as the keyboard is not lit at all.On a final note, the num lock key not having a lighting indicator isn't much of a problem for me but it is a thing, but it's a minor inconvenience for me, so I don't really see it as a major flaw or a problem.\n\n", "\n\n  I got this to link up with my work laptop.  I've used Logitech keyboards & mouses(mice?) for years.  Figured I couldn't go wrong with this one.I really didn't.  I like all the features and the ergonomic feel of it.  Soft key clicks which is nice.  Multimedia keys are a bonus as are the instant calculator and other macro keys.My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars (which I was hoping to do) is because there is no CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK light on the keyboard.  I guess I am to install software that will visually tell me on the screen if my CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK light is on.  I'm sure I'll get used to it, and who knows, it may be easier.  But  all keyboards I've used in the past 25 years always had a CAPS LOCK\\NUM LOCK\\SCROLL LOCK light ON the keyboard.  Who knows, I may be back to change my review once I get this special software installed.I don't use the mouse really because it's too small for my hand but will use it as a backup.  I have a Logitech Performance MX I use for the laptop.  Same one I use for my gaming and surfing desktop.Overall I'm very happy with my latest Logitech purchase.  Price is great, features are very good.  Can't go wrong with a Logitech!\n\n", "\n\n  The mouse and keyboard are supposed to function with the unifying software.  The mouse only functions with \"LOGITECH OPTIONS\" software and works properly with that software.  Unfortunately the keyboard can only be recognized by the older \"LOGITECH SETPOINT\" program.Both will function but you have to have both programs to change settings with the keyboard and mouse.  If you're running both programs settings for the mouse won't be maintained on a reboot.  If you shut off the old SETPOINT you keyboard doesn't function properly at startup but will operate after you boot up.  You have to click with your mouse to get to the logon, normally you can hit any key and it will go to logon in Windows.I would not recommend this productUPDATE: Have returned this set.

But seriously, each time I knocked my coffee into the keyboard, I always tried to salvage it but, unfortunately, liquids and electronics do not go well together!  Every time I had to replace my keyboard, the Logitech MK355 Keyboard & Mouse Combo was ALWAYS my first choice and, providing it was available, it was the only keyboard/mouse combo that I would purchase!  All the keys are exactly in the \"right\" spot.  I have never had any connectivity issues (except perhaps when 12 ounces of hot coffee got accidentally knocked over into the keyboard).

I know it was cheap, just did not realize it was junk. I am a hardcore HP fan, and have never had an HP keyboard fail, even after 9 years old. Finally connected with Logitech, after jumping through hoops (testing everything I had already tested) they sent me a replacement keyboard and mouse. Yes, one week in, this one works, but so did the other... for 90 days. The mouse is an M310, the scroll wheel is ROUGH and noisy.

The scroll wheel feels like rubber jelly you left in the sun for too long. The accuracy is decent for a cheap mouse though.The keyboard has good media and volume keys, which is nice. BUT - the ESC key is not where you would expect, and is VERY small and low profile, so you will OFTEN accidently press the upper leftmost key, which will essentially alt-tab you out of whatever you are doing.

So .. reconnected my older \"other brand\" mouse but since then have had all manner of \"losses of connectivity\" to the keyboard.

Figured I couldn't go wrong with this one.I really didn't.  I like all the features and the ergonomic feel of it.  Soft key clicks which is nice.  Multimedia keys are a bonus as are the instant calculator and other macro keys.My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars (which I was hoping to do) is because there is no CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK light on the keyboard.  I guess I am to install software that will visually tell me on the screen if my CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK light is on.  I'm sure I'll get used to it, and who knows, it may be easier.  But  all keyboards I've used in the past 25 years always had a CAPS LOCK\\NUM LOCK\\SCROLL LOCK light ON the keyboard.  Who knows, I may be back to change my review once I get this special software installed.I don't use the mouse really because it's too small for my hand but will use it as a backup.  I have a Logitech Performance MX I use for the laptop.  Same one I use for my gaming and surfing desktop.Overall I'm very happy with my latest Logitech purchase.  Price is great, features are very good.  Can't go wrong with a Logitech!\n\n", "\n\n  The mouse and keyboard are supposed to function with the unifying software.  The mouse only functions with \"LOGITECH OPTIONS\" software and works properly with that software.  Unfortunately the keyboard can only be recognized by the older \"LOGITECH SETPOINT\" program.Both will function but you have to have both programs to change settings with the keyboard and mouse.  If you're running both programs settings for the mouse won't be maintained on a reboot.  If you shut off the old SETPOINT you keyboard doesn't function properly at startup but will operate after you boot up.  You have to click with your mouse to get to the logon, normally you can hit any key and it will go to logon in Windows.I would not recommend this productUPDATE: Have returned this set.

Why so many times over such a short period?  Well, the keyboard is GREAT!  The problem is the user: I keep knocking my coffee over and into the keyboard!  Talk about feeling like an oaf!  But seriously, each time I knocked my coffee into the keyboard, I always tried to salvage it but, unfortunately, liquids and electronics do not go well together!  Every time I had to replace my keyboard, the Logitech MK355 Keyboard & Mouse Combo was ALWAYS my first choice and, providing it was available, it was the only keyboard/mouse combo that I would purchase!  All the keys are exactly in the \"right\" spot.  I have never had any connectivity issues (except perhaps when 12 ounces of hot coffee got accidentally knocked over into the keyboard).

It also has the standard sized function keys without any frills, which is perfect for developing code.

More specifically, I am using this on a Mac and I've set up the keyboard language change to be Cmd-<space>. However, if I type really fast, it misses it (e.g. it doesn't change the language).

It works \"okay\" but (a big but) the key letters and symbols wore off fast.  Good thing I know my keys however, there are times when it helps to be able to see them for one reason or another.

The keys on the keyboard are well-spaced and seem sturdy enough. The mouse lacks some features that gamers might want, but is still excellent at what it was intended to do. I'm not sure what the DPI on this thing is, but it serves adequately for clicking people's heads until they die, which seems to be the point of the entire FPS genre.A couple things against this product: the little protrusions on the F, J, and numberpad 5 keys that identify them to touch typists could be a bit bigger. When I'm looking at the screen and searching for the home row at the same time, it takes a bit longer because I don't always notice those keys. Also, as I mentioned earlier, the mouse is very feature-sparse. It has two buttons and a scroll wheel, but no thumb buttons or adjustable DPI. This doesn't matter for most people, but I will be buying another mouse for my gaming and keeping this one for other purposes. I shouldn't have tried to game with this basic mouse, but it is still a good one for what you pay.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.

It works \"okay\" but (a big but) the key letters and symbols wore off fast.  Good thing I know my keys however, there are times when it helps to be able to see them for one reason or another.

Build quality is great, and mouse is perfectly sized.However, I am posting this review so that people know the typing feel is kind of unsatisfying. The best way I can describe it is that it is both simultaneously too stiff (you have to push on each key harder than a normal keyboard) as well as too mushy (once you push down, it feels like you are pressing on styrofoam). It is not very pleasant. If I didn't need the \"quiet\" typing experience I would definitely opt for the other model.\n\n", "\n\n  This is a very quiet keyboard + mouse set and is super helpful to have while participating in video conferences or any situation where noise is not welcome.  This keyboard and mouse set will allow you to respectfully use your computer while speaking/listening to your meeting or while your child is taking a nap next to you while working from home.Two Negatives:1) This set is not compatible with a unifying receiver meaning that if the USB receiver breaks, I'll need to replace the set or that a new mouse cannot be used with this keyboard without adding a second micro USB receiver to your computer.  I assume that future generations of the SilentTouch feature will have options with unifying USB receivers.2) The mouse is too small for extended use. I am in between Medium and Large when purchasing men's gloves and I feel that my hand wraps around the entire mouse making prolonged clicking quite uncomfortable.  Usually, this would not be an issue but without a unifying receiver (see 1), I cannot add a larger mouse without losing one USB port.For the price, this is a total steal but I hope to find extensibility as a feature on future silent touch models.\n\n", "\n\n  Maybe it's because my previous keyboard was old, loud and sticky --- but I absolute love the completely quiet keys on this keyboard. The key layout is perfect for me, and unless your banging your fingers on the keycaps the sound probably couldn't be any less. I did notice that one key (the down-arrow key) is not as smooth as the others, but hey, it's still a really good keyboard/mouse combo for the money.  The mouse is also completely quiet but lack of a solid \"click\" feel took me some time to get used to. Now that I know what to expect, I'm more comfortable with it, but at first I felt like there was not enough tactile feedback to tell whether I'd actually clicked the mouse button. The scroll wheel works as well as expected --- but it's not completely quiet - probably more noise when scrolling the wheel than click from the buttons.  I appreciate that it comes will all batteries installed (two AAAs for the keyboard, one AA for the mouse), and that they have small pull-out insulators to keep them disconnected during shipping.  One warning (as noted in a few other reviews) --- while the mouse includes a slot for storing the tiny USB receiver (under the battery cover), the receiver IS NOT STORED THERE for shipping. Instead the receiver is held in a tiny opening in one of the box flaps - on the end of the box containing the mouse. Those who have not used a wireless keyboard before may not realize how small this receiver is and toss it out with the box.  Overall, this is a very nice product for the price. Good value.\n\n", "\n\n  Now that virtual meetings like Zoom and Teams are so prevalent, I found myself frequently typing notes during calls.  Someone once told me they could hear my typing in the background.  It was time to ditch the standard keyboard and get something quiet.I tried a couple different keyboards - 2 of the super thin scissor switch style keyboards (like Mac keyboards) but they were not very quiet.  The energy from your fingers kitting the keys transferred through to the desk so there was a hollow pounding sound while typing.  The keys were quieter, but the overall experience was the same/worse.THIS KEYBOARD is it.  Super quiet and the keys have a normal range of motion, with some springiness like typical keyboards.  So it feels like regular typing and is VERY QUIET.  And it was cheaper than most of the others.I don't use the mouse - I use a Logitech trackball mouse, so no opinion of the mouse.It should be noted, the USB unifying receiver for the keyboard (and mouse) is not universal.  So it will only work with these items.  I now have 2 USB unifying receivers in my laptop.  One for this keyboard and another for the trackball mouse.  It works for me but if you don't have multiple USB ports, you may need a multi-USB extender.  (I actually use one of these because I have several monitors and other USB devices to connect to my laptop.)Very satisfied with this keyboard as quiet typing was my #1 need.\n\n", "\n\n  I thought the usb dongle would be inside the mouse's battery compartment but upon closer inspection found the dongle affixed inside the box. I use this keyboard when in my bed for basic browsing and movie watching. It is silent and the long battery life is a plus. The only downside is that the keys do take more pressure to actuate then my main keyboard but thats not a problem for me since its not my main typing keyboard. for those who want a main typing keyboard look else ware because I can see getting carpel tunnel if I used this as my main keyboard. The mouse is your basic mouse that's slightly smaller then a standard mouse. its comfy, easy to click and does the job for me.\n\n", "\n\n  Bought to use via under-desk hub that sits in wire management tray.  Even though hub is < 3 feet away, very spotty connection.Lags significantly without line of sight, particularly the keyboard (which ironically is closer to the hub than mouse).  Very disappointing.At another desk I have a Logitech combo also connecting to under-desk hub; worked great for 7 years.  I expected same quality.This receiver IS NOT Logitech's well-known unifying one, FYI.  If you lose it, probably screwed since not compatible with orange-star unifying receiver (I tried pairing, no dice).If it was lag-free I'd love it.  Very quiet, both keyboard & mouse.  Limited profile on each.  The white looks great in a room with lots of white.Wish it worked out.\n\n", "\n\n  I gave this four stars because it does what I want it to do. It connects the mouse and the keyboard with a single USB receiver. The problem with it is something that I can get used to.  Over time.  I had to think about what qualifies as four stars, and I guess that's it.It advertises as noiseless, and it pretty much IS.  Even the mouse is very quiet.I know there are some coders who get an extra-noisy keyboard, and that can make all kinds of people around them crazy. I understand that the sensory feedback of those are comforting to the user. This set has a the feel of a normal logitech keyboard, but the lack of auditory feedback is jarring and disconcerting.  I probably will get used to it, but I don't know when that will be.This is great for those who don't want to disturb anyone who needs total silence.This is terrible for those who just want to look busy.\n\n", "\n\n  For years I had a combo Microsoft keyboard and mouse for my home desktop. Frankly, it sucked. I type--a lot and quickly at 50-60 WPM when I get going. The M'soft keyboard was stiff and while I didn't mind the click, it didn't respond like I thought it should. They key-travel was significant and I didn't care for the feel. The mouse was just OK.So, I decided to risk a whole $30 on a new keyboard and mouse. I've used Logitech for mice for many years and never had a problem with them, so I was pretty sure it would be fine. However, I was surprised at the quality and performance of the keyboard itself. It is SILENT. Again, I don't really mind clicking, but this was quite a surprise and the responsiveness was excellent. I quickly got up to my usual typing speed and don't miss the Microsoft combo at all.Installation takes about 15 seconds after you pull the battery tags and insert the dongle in your USB port of choice. (Sorry about the double entendre.) One nice feature is a tiny caps lock light in the upper right hand of the keyboard where you can actually see it. I have no idea how long the batteries will last, but batteries are cheap and ubiquitous, so that's not a concern.You can find specialty keyboards, gaming keyboards (no thanks) cheap and expensive keyboards. For the average user wanting solid performing input devices, this is a great choice and $30 well-spent.\n\n", "\n\n  Why did I wait so long to purchase this?!? First off, the usb is attached to the box that it comes in. I opened the mouse where the usb is normally stored, and there\u2019s a spot for it, but it was empty. Panic mode set in. Luckily I later found it attached to the box. The mouse and keyboard came with batteries, which is always a bonus. I simply plugged in the usb to my laptop and the mouse and keyboard both instantly started working. This is not your typical cheap keyboard. It has legs to angle it and it\u2019s truly silent. No loud clicking. Love love love.\n\n", "\n\n  So, it works for the reason I wanted this... for the price I can't complain much... typing feels like in between alaptop keyboard and a full ergonomic keyboard...Pros:- Yes, really silent- that's pretty much it...Cons:- Need extra pressure to type compared to regular keyboards (I had/have a K350 ergonomics keyboard, which was very loud when typing).- USB receiver is not logitech unifying receiver.- The mouse is flimsy, definitely a downgrade from M705 marathon mouse, so I am not using the mouse that came with it.over all, you get what you pay for... a $30 keyboard.

I'm by no means some power user that is gaming 24/7 and putting the keyboard through constant use. In fact, I do much more work on my laptop than my desktop.And yet, this thing chews through batteries like my dog wolfs down dog treats.The cycle goes about like this: Put in fresh batteries. The keyboard works great for approximately a month. Then erratic behavior begins. For example, it'll just completely freeze for 10 to 30 seconds and then blurt out a bunch of nonsense letters. Maybe it will just decide to key in an endless stream of spaces until you shut it off. Take the batteries out, put fresh ones in... and everything is fine again. Oh, and those batteries that were in it? Still usable. It's just that apparently unless there is ABSOLUTELY A FULL CHARGE, this keyboard just can't even. And it will throw a temper tantrum until you put fresh ones in.Honestly, if I could, I would sue Logitech for the battery replacement costs. Or the aggravation. Or maybe both.And the mouse isn't much better. The batteries in it are also supposed to last quite a long time. However, my experience has been, again, only a month or two before it quits. At least it doesn't get erratic like the keyboard. It just flat quits.Either way, Logitech's claims are absolute lies and fantasy. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if someone told me they have ties with the major battery companies for kickbacks.The shame of it all is that when these two items actually work (rarely), they are very comfortable to use.As is, I'm done with the aggravation. I'll be spending my money with a different company from now on. Logitech used to be a trusted brand. Now they are just an untrustworthy scam.\n\n", "\n\n  UPDATED 6 mos. Later: This product is definitely counterfeit. It is not actually a Logitech product although that's what the label says. It was half the price though and serves it's purpose. The side keys don't work and neither do any of the other keys besides the music control keys. I have used this product now for 6 months (Original purchase date 12/3/2016, date of review 06/05/2016). This product has ceased to be functional. I use it 3x/week for generally 6-7 hours/day as I work online. After about 3 mos. I had trouble connecting the product to my computer- I would have to fiddle with it and restart my computer in order for it to actually connect. Today, it is finally done. I cannot connect it to either my work computer or my home computer.-------- The true $75 Logitech keyboard/mouse combo that I bought at Office Depot lasted for about 4 years before I spilled coffee on it one too many times. It survived numerous glasses of water, a candle! with hot wax that I scraped from in between the keys, numerous moves, various children and replaced adapters. I would highly suggest forking out the $75 for the real thing and forget the $30 you save by purchasing this look-alike wannabe.\n\n", "\n\n  I generally only buy Logitech when I get third-party stuff because I trust the quality, and this keyboard is really good EXCEPT for one shocking problem. The keyboard sags in the center when resting your palms and typing. It makes this ANNOYING creaking sound that will drive you crazy. The good news is that I fixed it by applying some felt \u201cfeet\u201d under the center where is sags (see pic). Very easy, but WTF!!! Come on Logitech, are you guys sleeping at your work stations?!\n\n", "\n\n  Great UNTIL they start having poor contact, hesitation and finally after reading other posts see similiar pattern. Great and love the wave and all but the contacts wear quickly (I really expect more than a year from a Logitech (or any keyboard) .  I have other different Logitech keyboards and love them and they are 5 years old (wired) and not the wave. Wish they could put the same quality into this because the ergonomics are great.  ;(  I now have two sitting in a box, 1 purchased in 2013 and it died 2 years later, bought one last Nov. 2015 (now it's Sept. 2016) and so i guess I want to try to contact Logitech and see if they have any answers!UPDATE:  November. 2016 - I emailed thru Logitech website for warranty as I had another one as well both did the same thing. A few weeks later I got the one and only response from logitech Customer S. asking if I was SATISFIED with their response.  I clearly told them NO and then heard nothing.  A month later 2 new ones showed up at my door.  So since I'd bought another in the meantime a MK710 which I was TOLD was a better quality... we shall see.  I DO love the wave and ergonomics of it, but certainly not the life expectancy or the bizarre Customer Service - that I really am disappointed with Logitech about.\n\n", "\n\n  I decided to use bigger keyboard and mice at home, though I like my Logitech K360 and other Logitech mice.Pros:1. well-designed keyboard. The palm cushion is a little soft which makes you wrist feel comfortable when you are not typing. It may take some time to get used to the gradual wave-shaped contour, but I think it's good too.2. 18 programable keys.3. The size of M510 mice is exactly what I look for. Mouse Dimensions (height x width x depth): 2.56 in (65 mm) x 4.72 in (120 mm) x 1.61 in (41 mm)4. Battery life is long. According to Logitech, the keyboard has 3-year battery life, and the mouse has two years. Both of them use 2 AA batteris.Cons:1. No Caps-lock light in the keyboard.2. Home/End/Delete/PageUp/PageDown key layout is not good. I often press the bigger Delete key when I tend to click the End Key.3. The Logitech SetPoint software (6.67) does not support M510 mouse. I can pair my other Logitech devices in the Unifying Software and manage all of them in SetPoint, but M510 is an exception. I had to download another software Logitech Options to manage M510.\n\n", "\n\n  I purchased this set here on Amazon back in July of 2019 and it work perfectly with Windows 7 Pro,Then recently I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and everything went Down Hill from there, The Mouse will Freeze up on the screen,  and now some of the features on the Keyboard do not work, or sometimes when you hit a Key another letter or Number will show up.I have called Logitech numerous times and they have been very helpful, they even sent me a new Mouse & Wireless Receiver,  I then called support and even they could not get my problem solved,  now after trying to uninstall and reinstall the software with no results I,m going to just order a new Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse set and hope it will work.I would also like to add that I went to Walmart and purchased a Cheap wireless Mouse and ts working perfectly, so it has to be a problem with the Logitech software not being compatible with the Windows 10 upgrade.01/07/2020 Up DateAfter many hour on the phone with Logitech support, they finally gave up trying to get my Combo K350 Keyboard and M510 Mouse and told me to take Pictures of the Serial number on both items and sent it to them so they could send me Brand new upgraded replacements,Once they received the pictures they got back to me and inform me that the items I purchased here directly from Amazon are \"FAKES\" and were not manufactured by them but by and outfit in China that specializes in Fake Logitech products,  They told me that I should contact Amazon and inform them which I intent on doing in the morning,Just so you know I thought there was something Fishy about the Keyboard and Mouse because of the way the Serial Number was applied to the bottom of the Keyboard,  it was typed on a fake looking piece of paper and glued over a second sticker, in fact the M510 Mouse has no Serial or Model numbers at all on the bottom, and the Serial number on the Keyboard does not match anything Logitech made.(Update) 04/30/2020After many attempts on the phone with Logitech to get my Keyboard and Mouse to work with my updated Windows 10 I finally gave up, this was after the Keyboard had degraded so bad it became absolutely useless.I have ordered a Jelly Comb wireless Keyboard & Mouse here on Amazon after reading one review after another and I'm happy to say that they are both working flawlessly, including all the keys.\n\n", "\n\n  I don't usually write reviews on products over 2 years after I have had them but this is an exception.  Today I bid farewell to my wave keyboard as the 'A' key has officially stuck in a down position never to rise again.For starters, I am an individual who spends HOURS on a PC at a time.  I write fiction as a hobby as well as play hours of video games.  WASD are the keys that almost all games use to control characters now days... and with that, the hobby writing, and the general use... time has took a tole on the poor key and it can take no more.On to a review of the keyboard.  I really loved the ergonomic feel of the keyboard and the natural slant as well as the fact that it has two heights on its little feet.  I always used the 2nd height (not the base height and not the mega height), which was just perfect for the way I sat at my desk..  I actually had learned to type one handed on this keyboard due to its nature and cure.  It was mainly an ability I utilized on quick searches and links.....I utilized the extended function keys very rarely; though they were a nice feature of the keyboard.  Having them on the same as the normal function keys were a downplay as how often I used F2 and F5 alone made turning on the extended feature keys more of a hindrance than a help....I never understood SLEEP keys being on keyboards.  Until I rendered the key null in the options I hit the key a numerous times which was annoying at best....Battery life was wonderful.  Though I know I changed batteries just a couple of weeks ago.  I couldn't tell you when I changed them last and I NEVER turned the keyboard off until today when the key died.All in all, the keyboard lasted almost 3 years and had a great feel with excellent battery life.The mouse, however, died over a year ago; can't say much for that.  I remember having to change the batteries in the mouse more often than the keyboard.A negative I would find, overall, being the range of the wireless.  Wireless is not infinite; in fact, the range of this device's wireless to connection is really short.  I would have disconnect issues if I had the adapter on the back of my PC.  On the front of my PC there was zero issues with connectivity as it was merely just 3-4 inches away from the adapter.Regardless, RIP my Wave keyboard Feb 2015 - Dec 2017...you will be missed.  Just debating if I want to get the same kind or get a mechanical keyboard that allows removable keys next time.  Temporarily using a tiny basic keyboard until I decide.\n\n", "\n\n  Edit: Almost a year later and that keyboard is great!! Make sure to contact Logitech support if you have any issues because they will ship out a replacement. The mouse from the bundle is still the worst mouse I have ever used. I downloaded the software to customize the keys which was pretty useful. I disabled the the caps lock and reassigned the power button to go to sleep instead. Very cool!The keyboard is really nice and eases strain on the wrists. The wave key design was perfect for me because I always had trouble reaching keys with my pinkies. The only reason I give this product a bad review is due to the painful design of the mouse. The curve/Rest leaves no room for your ring finger and pinky to rest naturally. My hands are small/medium sized and it caused more pain than the keyboard can alleviate!I almost felt like it was designed for a lefty (I am but use the mouse in my right hand) or tries to be universal. I felt like Logitech was a trustworthy brand but I\u2019m going to have to find a new mouse so this will be a backup? I wish I just ordered the keyboard and saved a few dollars\n\n", "\n\n  At first this keyboard was excellent. (And so is the mouse.) It was sprung on me at my new job two years ago. I liked it so much I bought one for use at home. And then another.I like full stroke keys, and those are getting hard to find. This one has them. And the ergo-curvature is nice. The curve to the back is a bit excessive, though. That Esc key is farther away than what I'm used to. But I've become accustomed to it.Update: I found some white lithium grease at Home Depot. I removed every key, applied a tiny amount of the grease to the bottom of each key, and snapped the keys back into the keyboard. So far it's been over a year and the keys still move smoothly.If this weren't such a comfortable keyboard I'd simply have replaced it with some other keyboard. But the feel is excellent and no other keyboard works as well, so I wanted to refurbish this one. The grease did the trick.It's also useful that the wireless connect software allows you to use two keyboards and two mice on the same computer. I have that setup because I have one set of these on the desktop, and another at the piano nearby.But after a few months the keys start to bind a bit. It's not stickiness. It's friction. On one of the keyboards the friction seems to have diminished. That's the one I'm using right now.  But the keyboard by the piano still suffers from the friction. That one is not often used, so it's okay.  The third one was in my office for work-at-home use. The friction was intolerable, so I abandoned it for another keyboard.\n\n", "\n\n  Setup: Plug it in and go. Well, pull out the battery blocking strips, then go.Keyboard: Big, bulky and the key feel is okay. The keys have more travel than you find on laptops, but average for external KBs. I used, almost exclusively, mechanical KBs up to this point. This membrane KB isn't bad in terms of key press feel. It has a little higher key pressure until it pops over the resistance hill.  This is nice for my fidgety fingers. It has a little rubber impact at the bottom of the key travel, rather than a cheap plastic impact feel.The size of the KB overall isn't large, but it seems puffed up. The palm area on the KB is slightly cushy and a really nice touch. However, since the KB is taller off the surface, I find my hands sliding down off the KB. I haven't played with the other feature keys other than the volume, but they seem to work fine.Mouse: The mouse is the fine M510. Well weighted and the switches are just fine. I us mostly gaming mice, so the symmetrical shape of the mouse has my RH ring and pinky searching for a stable place to grip and to keep the mouse pointed straight. The shape would be great for people used to regular mice, but is unfulfilling for people used to gaming mice. I find myself either palming the mouse to move my fingers up or use a grip with three fingers on top of the mouse.Overall: If you are used to standard KB and mice, this setup will be pretty nice.  If you are used to KBs with Cherry switches and gaming mice, you may not be satisfied. That's okay though. DIfferent strokes for different folks with different uses. I am using this for my WFH office. Wireless and the solid reputation of Logitech where the most important factors in my decision and I'm not regretting getting this setup.\n\n", "\n\n  According to my purchase history, I bought this almost exactly 3 years ago.According to the claims on the product description, the estimated battery life of the keyboard is also 3 years.During the time that I've owned this piece of hot garbage, I can guarantee you that I've spent more on batteries than this hunk of useless plastic cost. I'm by no means some power user that is gaming 24/7 and putting the keyboard through constant use. In fact, I do much more work on my laptop than my desktop.And yet, this thing chews through batteries like my dog wolfs down dog treats.The cycle goes about like this: Put in fresh batteries. The keyboard works great for approximately a month. Then erratic behavior begins. For example, it'll just completely freeze for 10 to 30 seconds and then blurt out a bunch of nonsense letters. Maybe it will just decide to key in an endless stream of spaces until you shut it off. Take the batteries out, put fresh ones in... and everything is fine again. Oh, and those batteries that were in it? Still usable. It's just that apparently unless there is ABSOLUTELY A FULL CHARGE, this keyboard just can't even. And it will throw a temper tantrum until you put fresh ones in.Honestly, if I could, I would sue Logitech for the battery replacement costs. Or the aggravation. Or maybe both.And the mouse isn't much better. The batteries in it are also supposed to last quite a long time. However, my experience has been, again, only a month or two before it quits. At least it doesn't get erratic like the keyboard. It just flat quits.Either way, Logitech's claims are absolute lies and fantasy. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if someone told me they have ties with the major battery companies for kickbacks.The shame of it all is that when these two items actually work (rarely), they are very comfortable to use.As is, I'm done with the aggravation. I'll be spending my money with a different company from now on. Logitech used to be a trusted brand. Now they are just an untrustworthy scam.\n\n", "\n\n  UPDATED 6 mos. Later: This product is definitely counterfeit. It is not actually a Logitech product although that's what the label says. It was half the price though and serves it's purpose. The side keys don't work and neither do any of the other keys besides the music control keys. I have used this product now for 6 months (Original purchase date 12/3/2016, date of review 06/05/2016). This product has ceased to be functional. I use it 3x/week for generally 6-7 hours/day as I work online. After about 3 mos. I had trouble connecting the product to my computer- I would have to fiddle with it and restart my computer in order for it to actually connect. Today, it is finally done. I cannot connect it to either my work computer or my home computer.-------- The true $75 Logitech keyboard/mouse combo that I bought at Office Depot lasted for about 4 years before I spilled coffee on it one too many times. It survived numerous glasses of water, a candle! with hot wax that I scraped from in between the keys, numerous moves, various children and replaced adapters. I would highly suggest forking out the $75 for the real thing and forget the $30 you save by purchasing this look-alike wannabe.\n\n", "\n\n  I generally only buy Logitech when I get third-party stuff because I trust the quality, and this keyboard is really good EXCEPT for one shocking problem. The keyboard sags in the center when resting your palms and typing. It makes this ANNOYING creaking sound that will drive you crazy. The good news is that I fixed it by applying some felt \u201cfeet\u201d under the center where is sags (see pic). Very easy, but WTF!!! Come on Logitech, are you guys sleeping at your work stations?!\n\n", "\n\n  Great UNTIL they start having poor contact, hesitation and finally after reading other posts see similiar pattern. Great and love the wave and all but the contacts wear quickly (I really expect more than a year from a Logitech (or any keyboard) .  I have other different Logitech keyboards and love them and they are 5 years old (wired) and not the wave. Wish they could put the same quality into this because the ergonomics are great.  ;(  I now have two sitting in a box, 1 purchased in 2013 and it died 2 years later, bought one last Nov. 2015 (now it's Sept. 2016) and so i guess I want to try to contact Logitech and see if they have any answers!UPDATE:  November. 2016 - I emailed thru Logitech website for warranty as I had another one as well both did the same thing. A few weeks later I got the one and only response from logitech Customer S. asking if I was SATISFIED with their response.  I clearly told them NO and then heard nothing.  A month later 2 new ones showed up at my door.  So since I'd bought another in the meantime a MK710 which I was TOLD was a better quality... we shall see.  I DO love the wave and ergonomics of it, but certainly not the life expectancy or the bizarre Customer Service - that I really am disappointed with Logitech about.\n\n", "\n\n  I decided to use bigger keyboard and mice at home, though I like my Logitech K360 and other Logitech mice.Pros:1. well-designed keyboard.

I had to download another software Logitech Options to manage M510.\n\n", "\n\n  I purchased this set here on Amazon back in July of 2019 and it work perfectly with Windows 7 Pro,Then recently I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro and everything went Down Hill from there, The Mouse will Freeze up on the screen,  and now some of the features on the Keyboard do not work, or sometimes when you hit a Key another letter or Number will show up.I have called Logitech numerous times and they have been very helpful, they even sent me a new Mouse & Wireless Receiver,  I then called support and even they could not get my problem solved,  now after trying to uninstall and reinstall the software with no results I,m going to just order a new Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse set and hope it will work.I would also like to add that I went to Walmart and purchased a Cheap wireless Mouse and ts working perfectly, so it has to be a problem with the Logitech software not being compatible with the Windows 10 upgrade.01/07/2020 Up DateAfter many hour on the phone with Logitech support, they finally gave up trying to get my Combo K350 Keyboard and M510 Mouse and told me to take Pictures of the Serial number on both items and sent it to them so they could send me Brand new upgraded replacements,Once they received the pictures they got back to me and inform me that the items I purchased here directly from Amazon are \"FAKES\" and were not manufactured by them but by and outfit in China that specializes in Fake Logitech products,  They told me that I should contact Amazon and inform them which I intent on doing in the morning,Just so you know I thought there was something Fishy about the Keyboard and Mouse because of the way the Serial Number was applied to the bottom of the Keyboard,  it was typed on a fake looking piece of paper and glued over a second sticker, in fact the M510 Mouse has no Serial or Model numbers at all on the bottom, and the Serial number on the Keyboard does not match anything Logitech made.(Update) 04/30/2020After many attempts on the phone with Logitech to get my Keyboard and Mouse to work with my updated Windows 10 I finally gave up, this was after the Keyboard had degraded so bad it became absolutely useless.I have ordered a Jelly Comb wireless Keyboard & Mouse here on Amazon after reading one review after another and I'm happy to say that they are both working flawlessly, including all the keys.\n\n", "\n\n  I don't usually write reviews on products over 2 years after I have had them but this is an exception.  Today I bid farewell to my wave keyboard as the 'A' key has officially stuck in a down position never to rise again.For starters, I am an individual who spends HOURS on a PC at a time.  I write fiction as a hobby as well as play hours of video games.  WASD are the keys that almost all games use to control characters now days... and with that, the hobby writing, and the general use... time has took a tole on the poor key and it can take no more.On to a review of the keyboard.  I really loved the ergonomic feel of the keyboard and the natural slant as well as the fact that it has two heights on its little feet.  I always used the 2nd height (not the base height and not the mega height), which was just perfect for the way I sat at my desk..  I actually had learned to type one handed on this keyboard due to its nature and cure.  It was mainly an ability I utilized on quick searches and links.....I utilized the extended function keys very rarely; though they were a nice feature of the keyboard.  Having them on the same as the normal function keys were a downplay as how often I used F2 and F5 alone made turning on the extended feature keys more of a hindrance than a help....I never understood SLEEP keys being on keyboards.  Until I rendered the key null in the options I hit the key a numerous times which was annoying at best....Battery life was wonderful.  Though I know I changed batteries just a couple of weeks ago.  I couldn't tell you when I changed them last and I NEVER turned the keyboard off until today when the key died.All in all, the keyboard lasted almost 3 years and had a great feel with excellent battery life.The mouse, however, died over a year ago; can't say much for that.  I remember having to change the batteries in the mouse more often than the keyboard.A negative I would find, overall, being the range of the wireless.  Wireless is not infinite; in fact, the range of this device's wireless to connection is really short.  I would have disconnect issues if I had the adapter on the back of my PC.  On the front of my PC there was zero issues with connectivity as it was merely just 3-4 inches away from the adapter.Regardless, RIP my Wave keyboard Feb 2015 - Dec 2017...you will be missed.  Just debating if I want to get the same kind or get a mechanical keyboard that allows removable keys next time.  Temporarily using a tiny basic keyboard until I decide.\n\n", "\n\n  Edit: Almost a year later and that keyboard is great!! Make sure to contact Logitech support if you have any issues because they will ship out a replacement. The mouse from the bundle is still the worst mouse I have ever used. I downloaded the software to customize the keys which was pretty useful. I disabled the the caps lock and reassigned the power button to go to sleep instead. Very cool!The keyboard is really nice and eases strain on the wrists. The wave key design was perfect for me because I always had trouble reaching keys with my pinkies. The only reason I give this product a bad review is due to the painful design of the mouse. The curve/Rest leaves no room for your ring finger and pinky to rest naturally. My hands are small/medium sized and it caused more pain than the keyboard can alleviate!I almost felt like it was designed for a lefty (I am but use the mouse in my right hand) or tries to be universal. I felt like Logitech was a trustworthy brand but I\u2019m going to have to find a new mouse so this will be a backup? I wish I just ordered the keyboard and saved a few dollars\n\n", "\n\n  At first this keyboard was excellent. (And so is the mouse.) It was sprung on me at my new job two years ago. I liked it so much I bought one for use at home. And then another.I like full stroke keys, and those are getting hard to find. This one has them. And the ergo-curvature is nice. The curve to the back is a bit excessive, though. That Esc key is farther away than what I'm used to. But I've become accustomed to it.Update: I found some white lithium grease at Home Depot. I removed every key, applied a tiny amount of the grease to the bottom of each key, and snapped the keys back into the keyboard. So far it's been over a year and the keys still move smoothly.If this weren't such a comfortable keyboard I'd simply have replaced it with some other keyboard. But the feel is excellent and no other keyboard works as well, so I wanted to refurbish this one. The grease did the trick.It's also useful that the wireless connect software allows you to use two keyboards and two mice on the same computer. I have that setup because I have one set of these on the desktop, and another at the piano nearby.But after a few months the keys start to bind a bit. It's not stickiness. It's friction. On one of the keyboards the friction seems to have diminished. That's the one I'm using right now.  But the keyboard by the piano still suffers from the friction. That one is not often used, so it's okay.  The third one was in my office for work-at-home use. The friction was intolerable, so I abandoned it for another keyboard.\n\n", "\n\n  Setup: Plug it in and go. Well, pull out the battery blocking strips, then go.Keyboard: Big, bulky and the key feel is okay. The keys have more travel than you find on laptops, but average for external KBs. I used, almost exclusively, mechanical KBs up to this point. This membrane KB isn't bad in terms of key press feel. It has a little higher key pressure until it pops over the resistance hill.  This is nice for my fidgety fingers. It has a little rubber impact at the bottom of the key travel, rather than a cheap plastic impact feel.The size of the KB overall isn't large, but it seems puffed up. The palm area on the KB is slightly cushy and a really nice touch. However, since the KB is taller off the surface, I find my hands sliding down off the KB. I haven't played with the other feature keys other than the volume, but they seem to work fine.Mouse: The mouse is the fine M510. Well weighted and the switches are just fine. I us mostly gaming mice, so the symmetrical shape of the mouse has my RH ring and pinky searching for a stable place to grip and to keep the mouse pointed straight. The shape would be great for people used to regular mice, but is unfulfilling for people used to gaming mice. I find myself either palming the mouse to move my fingers up or use a grip with three fingers on top of the mouse.Overall: If you are used to standard KB and mice, this setup will be pretty nice.  If you are used to KBs with Cherry switches and gaming mice, you may not be satisfied. That's okay though. DIfferent strokes for different folks with different uses. I am using this for my WFH office. Wireless and the solid reputation of Logitech where the most important factors in my decision and I'm not regretting getting this setup.\n\n", "\n\n  According to my purchase history, I bought this almost exactly 3 years ago.According to the claims on the product description, the estimated battery life of the keyboard is also 3 years.During the time that I've owned this piece of hot garbage, I can guarantee you that I've spent more on batteries than this hunk of useless plastic cost. I'm by no means some power user that is gaming 24/7 and putting the keyboard through constant use. In fact, I do much more work on my laptop than my desktop.And yet, this thing chews through batteries like my dog wolfs down dog treats.The cycle goes about like this: Put in fresh batteries. The keyboard works great for approximately a month. Then erratic behavior begins. For example, it'll just completely freeze for 10 to 30 seconds and then blurt out a bunch of nonsense letters. Maybe it will just decide to key in an endless stream of spaces until you shut it off. Take the batteries out, put fresh ones in... and everything is fine again. Oh, and those batteries that were in it? Still usable. It's just that apparently unless there is ABSOLUTELY A FULL CHARGE, this keyboard just can't even. And it will throw a temper tantrum until you put fresh ones in.Honestly, if I could, I would sue Logitech for the battery replacement costs. Or the aggravation. Or maybe both.And the mouse isn't much better. The batteries in it are also supposed to last quite a long time. However, my experience has been, again, only a month or two before it quits. At least it doesn't get erratic like the keyboard. It just flat quits.Either way, Logitech's claims are absolute lies and fantasy. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if someone told me they have ties with the major battery companies for kickbacks.The shame of it all is that when these two items actually work (rarely), they are very comfortable to use.As is, I'm done with the aggravation. I'll be spending my money with a different company from now on. Logitech used to be a trusted brand. Now they are just an untrustworthy scam.\n\n", "\n\n  UPDATED 6 mos. Later: This product is definitely counterfeit. It is not actually a Logitech product although that's what the label says. It was half the price though and serves it's purpose. The side keys don't work and neither do any of the other keys besides the music control keys. I have used this product now for 6 months (Original purchase date 12/3/2016, date of review 06/05/2016). This product has ceased to be functional. I use it 3x/week for generally 6-7 hours/day as I work online. After about 3 mos. I had trouble connecting the product to my computer- I would have to fiddle with it and restart my computer in order for it to actually connect. Today, it is finally done. I cannot connect it to either my work computer or my home computer.-------- The true $75 Logitech keyboard/mouse combo that I bought at Office Depot lasted for about 4 years before I spilled coffee on it one too many times. It survived numerous glasses of water, a candle! with hot wax that I scraped from in between the keys, numerous moves, various children and replaced adapters. I would highly suggest forking out the $75 for the real thing and forget the $30 you save by purchasing this look-alike wannabe.\n\n", "\n\n  I generally only buy Logitech when I get third-party stuff because I trust the quality, and this keyboard is really good EXCEPT for one shocking problem. The keyboard sags in the center when resting your palms and typing. It makes this ANNOYING creaking sound that will drive you crazy. The good news is that I fixed it by applying some felt \u201cfeet\u201d under the center where is sags (see pic). Very easy, but WTF!!! Come on Logitech, are you guys sleeping at your work stations?!\n\n", "\n\n  Great UNTIL they start having poor contact, hesitation and finally after reading other posts see similiar pattern. Great and love the wave and all but the contacts wear quickly (I really expect more than a year from a Logitech (or any keyboard) .  I have other different Logitech keyboards and love them and they are 5 years old (wired) and not the wave. Wish they could put the same quality into this because the ergonomics are great.  ;(  I now have two sitting in a box, 1 purchased in 2013 and it died 2 years later, bought one last Nov. 2015 (now it's Sept. 2016) and so i guess I want to try to contact Logitech and see if they have any answers!UPDATE:  November. 2016 - I emailed thru Logitech website for warranty as I had another one as well both did the same thing. A few weeks later I got the one and only response from logitech Customer S. asking if I was SATISFIED with their response.  I clearly told them NO and then heard nothing.  A month later 2 new ones showed up at my door.  So since I'd bought another in the meantime a MK710 which I was TOLD was a better quality... we shall see.  I DO love the wave and ergonomics of it, but certainly not the life expectancy or the bizarre Customer Service - that I really am disappointed with Logitech about.\n\n", "\n\n  I decided to use bigger keyboard and mice at home, though I like my Logitech K360 and other Logitech mice.Pros:1. well-designed keyboard. The palm cushion is a little soft which makes you wrist feel comfortable when you are not typing. It may take some time to get used to the gradual wave-shaped contour, but I think it's good too.2. 18 programable keys.3. The size of M510 mice is exactly what I look for. Mouse Dimensions (height x width x depth): 2.56 in (65 mm) x 4.72 in (120 mm) x 1.61 in (41 mm)4. Battery life is long. According to Logitech, the keyboard has 3-year battery life, and the mouse has two years. Both of them use 2 AA batteris.Cons:1. No Caps-lock light in the keyboard.2. Home/End/Delete/PageUp/PageDown key layout is not good. I often press the bigger Delete key when I tend to click the End Key.3. The Logitech SetPoint software (6.67) does not support M510 mouse. I can pair my other Logitech devices in the Unifying Software and manage all of them in SetPoint, but M510 is an exception.

The design quality is good. The mouse is probably a good size for a child or person with extra small hands. FYI, it's grey colored, not black.HOWEVER....This is in now way worth the $29.99 list price (I purchased it on sale for about half that price). While the design quality is good, the keyboard is lightweight and flimsy.  I could only recommend this keyboard for a seldom or lightly used computer. It doesn't feel sturdy enough for gaming or to spend hours of typing.Also, the mouse is HORRIBLE! The mouse feel like a toy mouse for a preschool child's toy computer. If you have any issues with wrist pain or strain I feel you should NOT use this mouse because  it may make your issues worse. Actually, I am a bit shocked that this is a Logitech product.Finally, this does not work with the Logitech Unifying receiver.. I knew this when I purchased it, but I did not realize that (for me) the mouse would not be usable. So, now I have to buy a separate wireless mouse to replace the mouse the came with this item.  But, If you consider that most modern laptops have only 2 USB ports, if you decide to not use the mouse and get a better one you will need to use 2 of your USB ports. I tried plugging the wireless receiver into a USB hub, but it did not work for me.\n\n", "\n\n  I have to say right up front that I am NOT a tech expert by any means.  I just simply know when something works well and when it doesn't.I've purchased three of these keyboard/mouse sets since January 2018 and I think it's one of the best pieces of equipment that I've added to my computer set up.  I run 3 to 4 laptops every day, each one accomplishes a different task for me.  It was getting to be a real pain having to stand up and stretch across the desk to enter a password or move the mouse and these solved that problem for me.  It did take some getting used to at first since each set looks exactly alike but I have that worked out with their placements.  LOL!The set in the photo is the first set that I purchased on January 29, 2018.  This set is used for HOURS darn near every day.  I write online content so my keyboards always take a beating.  This one has held up BEAUTIFULLY and, as a bonus, I've only had to replace the battery in the mouse once.  My guess is that somehow I got super charged batteries in the keyboard because it is still going on the originals.  The other two sets are still running off of 100% original batteries.There isn't one thing that I can complain about with this set.  I like that there are little flip out legs on the bottom/back part of the keyboard that allow it to lean up in the back.  It makes it much easier to use.  I like that there can be some distance between the keyboard/mouse and the computer when being used and I LOVE that there are no wires to deal with.All in all it's a great set that is worth the money.  I have three of these sets and each one is fantastic.\n\n", "\n\n  This is a wonderful keyboard.  I have tried many many wireless keyboards for work including gaming keyboards such as Razer keyboard to boast typing productivity.  Whats nice about a wireless keyboard is when you need more space you can just pick it up and move it aside for more room.  Major reason why I am switching over to wirelessTyping on it is very soft, quiet and accurate.  The major plus to this keyboard vs others including the newer generation logitech wireless keyboards are:1.  The function keys on this model and this model only are large and regular sized like the rest of the keys on the keyboard.  The new models have tiny half-size function keys.  So if you use functions keys for work or specialized software, this model is a huge plus.2.  The keys are not spaced apart like many wireless keyboards, which leaves room for bigger keys and makes typing easier and more accurate. The keys are the nice and big like on the keys on the new macbook pro.  I didn\u2019t realize my usb keyboard keys were small until I used this wireless keyboard.3.  Keyboard is very compact and does not take very much space. I feel all new computers should include a wireless keyboard such as this keyboard just like what apple does when they sell imac\u2019s, they include a wireless keyboard and mouse.  The only con is the wireless mouse is a little too small  but that ok, I use a separate logitech M510 wireless, the best in my opinion.\n\n", "\n\n  How can Logitech actually screw up a keyboard but they did.  I bought two of these for work and home.  Using the BT dongle for both and making sure to install the Logitech app to be sure all firmware is current and settings correct.  So if the keyboard get's an average of 4.7 stars for ergonomics, battery life, and ease of use, why did i give it 1 star.  It doesn't capture all keystrokes when typing.  It has one job, type what keys i press and it can't do that consistently.I started noticing the problem almost immediately at my office, to the point i actually had my laptop replaced, including the docking station thinking it was the laptop or docking interface having issues.  Nope, still kept buffering and missing key strokes.  This is a big issue to me programming network equipment.  I can't afford to be having issues like this.  Even the mouse would miss clicks randomly.Switched to another brand and no more issues.So the thought was maybe BT interference.  Yet the same problem exists at my home office with a different laptop and far less electrical EM transmissions in the area, yet still get buffering keystrokes.  To where i can type 10 letters and see nothing being received then about 5 of the last string being received and typed.Really disappointed.  I cannot recommend especially since I have two keyboard / mouse combos  with the same issue.\n\n", "\n\n  When the demarcations on my Dell Inspiron's keyboard started to wear away after three years daily use I looked for a good but reasonably priced replacement.  This Logitech definitely fit the bill, providing a wireless keyboard and a mouse whose quality pretty well matched the originals. And at a very fair price.Setup with my Windows 10 running computer was automatic and almost instantaneous.  (The same units installed on my wife's Windows 7 running computer was also \"automatic,\" but somewhat slow. -So much that I at first thought it had failed.)The keyboard has a nice, solid, feel.  The mouse is a bit smaller than the one it replaced, but is not too small for comfortable use.Highly recommmended!\n\n", "\n\n  Works great! Plug and play, there wasn't anything to it, super easy installation! The only reason for 4 stars is because there is no indicator light on the keyboard to say:  It's on / cap-lock is on / Num. lock is on. So your just kind of left to guess if they are on or not. Also there is no light on the mouse either to let you know that its on.\n\n", "\n\n  I wanted to like this keyboard, but it has too many problems.Keys are too close together. Instead of the typical tapered keycaps, these keycaps are squared off. So I'm constantly hitting the wrong keys. (I'm not a bad typist; I just have big fingers.)Also, the receiver is not a Unifying receiver, so I can't pair it with my existing M510's. I wish I'd known that before buying. I would have passed\n\n", "\n\n  I've had this product for less than three months and cannot use it.When I try to write at normal speed, the keyboard can't keep up. It stalls, then only writes about half of the sentence and completely stops. It also inserts too many characters, like 'sssstop' when I press 's' only once, and sometimes it will take a few second between each character so I have to breathe deeply and type in slo-mo if I want to use it at all.

My guess is that somehow I got super charged batteries in the keyboard because it is still going on the originals.  The other two sets are still running off of 100% original batteries.There isn't one thing that I can complain about with this set.  I like that there are little flip out legs on the bottom/back part of the keyboard that allow it to lean up in the back.  It makes it much easier to use.  I like that there can be some distance between the keyboard/mouse and the computer when being used and I LOVE that there are no wires to deal with.All in all it's a great set that is worth the money.

The keyboard and mouse have standard key and mouse click sounds...nothing out of the norm.With having more conf/video calls the K520 keyboard caused noise issues while taking notes on calls. While I can mute myself, it's not optimal if you're one of the primary participants that trying to take notes and be fluid.After searching on \"quiet or silent keyboards\" I ordered the MK470 and MK235 keyboard mouse combo sets. While not technically \"silent\" the MK470 is the quieter keyboard between the two and much quieter than the original keyboard + mouse combo. in the attached video I tried to be as consistent and realistic when illustrating the sounds of the keys and mouse clicks. All of this is objective and i'm simply trying to give a helpful review for others who may have the same needs.In an additional effort to reduce keystroke noise I also purchased an inexpensive wireless headset to move the mic further away from the keyboard vs. being located on my earbud cord. Switching to the headset itself could possibly reduce the keyboard noise heard on a call, but that said, I have co-workers who use the K520 during meetings with their webcam + mics that are mounted on the top of their monitor and the keystroke noise is quite intense. Again, many factors to consider in mic quality, etc.Overall i like the MK470. It is a condensed full keyboard that types like a laptop keyboard. The keys are quieter than most and I've confirmed the ability to type during meetings w/out being disruptive. The only short-term challenge for me is getting used to the location of the forward delete button which is differnt than a full-sized extended keyboard layout. I will be recommending this keyboard to my co-workers who also need to type during calls. Good luck to you in our new norm and I hope this was helpful.\n\n", "\n\n  Update: Had to come down to 1 star from 5 star for one reason - this is NOT a Logitech unifying device. If you lose the tiny USB connector, you are SOL and must replace the whole thing rather than be able to connect to the unifying USB receiver.

I am loving it 95%. It's small, sleek, slim, thin profiled, very quiet keys, and very smooth typing, feels just like using a laptop's keyboard. No issues getting the receiver to quickly pair it right up and it was ready to go. I do love how thin it is and I love how quiet the keys are. It also has a very nice weight to it, more on the heavy side. It's heavier than it looks to be so thin. To me, that's a good thing, that I'd hope will mean it's sturdy, strong, built to last, and that it won't be sliding all around my desk from being too light weight. It's just what I'd been wanting. I'd tried MANY other keyboards from amazon that were all about this thin, but they were from more generic brands, and all of them had to be returned for pairing issues or function issues.My only issues here would have to be: No on/off switch. Not a deal breaker for some, but it's just something I'd like to have, because for so many years, it's always been there. Use it or not, it was there. Another issue would be that I'm really surprised that with all of the wasted space on the top side of the keyboard, Logitech could have included a special battery and sold this as a rechargeable keyboard. The whole \"gray strip\" at the top comes off to reveal the extra space and also where the 2 AAA batteries are located.  And I will hope that this keyboard performs like my other logitech keyboards, which means that it will have great battery life even using the 2 AAA batteries. Time will tell.  Again it's just my opinion, so not a deal breaker. The keyboard doesn't have a lot of fancy gadgets or buttons, and I paid $50 for the keyboard and mouse, and I do like it, so I'm happy.Only other issue here would be the mouse that comes with this...it is very small, very thin, and low profile. It is much too small for my preferences on how I want my mouse to feel, so I will continue to use my logitech M525 mouse happily. I think a lot of people will probably like the mouse though, and I read that a lot of people compare it to an apple mouse design, since its so small and sleek. It is ultra-quiet, you almost can't hear the clicks at all, so as long as it's not too small for your hands,  you'll probably love using it.So in short, if you'd like a thin and quiet keyboard with a number pad, soft, quiet keys that type just like a laptop, this is a very nice design and it seems to be working great right out of the box.

The keyboard and mouse have standard key and mouse click sounds...nothing out of the norm.With having more conf/video calls the K520 keyboard caused noise issues while taking notes on calls. While I can mute myself, it's not optimal if you're one of the primary participants that trying to take notes and be fluid.After searching on \"quiet or silent keyboards\" I ordered the MK470 and MK235 keyboard mouse combo sets. While not technically \"silent\" the MK470 is the quieter keyboard between the two and much quieter than the original keyboard + mouse combo. in the attached video I tried to be as consistent and realistic when illustrating the sounds of the keys and mouse clicks. All of this is objective and i'm simply trying to give a helpful review for others who may have the same needs.In an additional effort to reduce keystroke noise I also purchased an inexpensive wireless headset to move the mic further away from the keyboard vs. being located on my earbud cord. Switching to the headset itself could possibly reduce the keyboard noise heard on a call, but that said, I have co-workers who use the K520 during meetings with their webcam + mics that are mounted on the top of their monitor and the keystroke noise is quite intense. Again, many factors to consider in mic quality, etc.Overall i like the MK470. It is a condensed full keyboard that types like a laptop keyboard. The keys are quieter than most and I've confirmed the ability to type during meetings w/out being disruptive. The only short-term challenge for me is getting used to the location of the forward delete button which is differnt than a full-sized extended keyboard layout. I will be recommending this keyboard to my co-workers who also need to type during calls. Good luck to you in our new norm and I hope this was helpful.\n\n", "\n\n  Update: Had to come down to 1 star from 5 star for one reason - this is NOT a Logitech unifying device. If you lose the tiny USB connector, you are SOL and must replace the whole thing rather than be able to connect to the unifying USB receiver. The main reason I bought this laptop was to travel, but I don't use the mouse it comes with, so there is no off/off switch on the keyboard and nowhere to nest/store the USB receiver during transit. It's really easy to lose as a result. Can't recommend because of the hassle I'm facing now.This is just the keyboard I was looking for to enhance working from home! I will even use it when I'm traveling. I previously got a laptop stand that is great for ergonomic posture, but was awkward to type on.Pros:+ Setup is instant. I have to admit I was worried that it would be tricky to set up the Bluetooth but all you do is plug in the small USB receiver and you're all set :)+ Stylish and super slim, great for people of any height as you won't have to bend your wrist to access the keys on a tabletop or desk.+ Works perfectly with the Kensington slim wrist rest!! Seriously like made for each other. I am used to a plastic wrist rest and hate the thick bubble gel ones. This one is flat, smooth (leatherette feel), and firm.Cons:The mouse they include... I guess it's nice that both the mouse and keyboard use the same USB receiver, but it's not a good mouse. I LOVE my Logitech M330 wireless mouse and wish they included one like that in the package. Super minor con for me since I already have a wireless mouse that I love.\n\n", "\n\n  I was looking for a bluetooth keyboard and mouse combo since I do a lot of typing and work from home. I borrowed a mechanical keyboard from my nephew and boy did I make the wrong decision! So loud! I had a smaller bluetooth keyboard, the Logitech K380, but I missed not having a 10-key. Did some research on keyboards that wouldn't break the bank and found this. I didn't need a mouse, but for the combination, why not? It's great, so nice and quiet and feels super comfy, I would recommend a wrist rest because it lays pretty flat. I wish the keyboard had an on/off switch but it doesn't bother me too much since half the time I forget to turn it off anyways. I highly recommend.\n\n", "\n\n  So, my usage of this is kind of uncommon. I own a wacom cintiq (Im a 3D asset developer) I often need to use keyboard shortcuts with working... and my cintiq (which I also use a lot) sits on a desk extension to my right, which has its own keyboard drawer (but its much smaller... a standard keyboard doesnt fit) It was really awkward to use my normal keyboard, coz its way over to the left... so I had to lean way over or try to fit it on the smaller keyboard drawer. It was quite annoying for some tasks.I decided to buy this and have both keyboards on my machine... but this one is for just working on the cintiq, and using keyboard shortcuts when I need to. Between the cintiq and the second keyboard, its like having a second computer - I can now do all kinds of things on it, utilizing it as a second monitor, as well as a drawing tablet. It has really increased my workflow speed with lots of different tasks. And its great coz its wireless... so you can really move it about, and still get a strong signal.The keyboard itself is lovely... space saving, quiet typing (much like a laptop's keys feel) and its heavy for a little keyboard. Its quite sturdy and seems very well built. As for the mouse, I'm not using that atm... so Ive stored it away in case I need a spare.You really cant go wrong with this set. The price is good, and its very portable too.\n\n", "\n\n  First impression review right out of the box and after first few uses for sending emails and typing up this review: I gotta say 4 stars out of 5 is my first impression. I am loving it 95%. It's small, sleek, slim, thin profiled, very quiet keys, and very smooth typing, feels just like using a laptop's keyboard. No issues getting the receiver to quickly pair it right up and it was ready to go. I do love how thin it is and I love how quiet the keys are. It also has a very nice weight to it, more on the heavy side. It's heavier than it looks to be so thin. To me, that's a good thing, that I'd hope will mean it's sturdy, strong, built to last, and that it won't be sliding all around my desk from being too light weight. It's just what I'd been wanting. I'd tried MANY other keyboards from amazon that were all about this thin, but they were from more generic brands, and all of them had to be returned for pairing issues or function issues.My only issues here would have to be: No on/off switch. Not a deal breaker for some, but it's just something I'd like to have, because for so many years, it's always been there. Use it or not, it was there. Another issue would be that I'm really surprised that with all of the wasted space on the top side of the keyboard, Logitech could have included a special battery and sold this as a rechargeable keyboard. The whole \"gray strip\" at the top comes off to reveal the extra space and also where the 2 AAA batteries are located.  And I will hope that this keyboard performs like my other logitech keyboards, which means that it will have great battery life even using the 2 AAA batteries. Time will tell.  Again it's just my opinion, so not a deal breaker. The keyboard doesn't have a lot of fancy gadgets or buttons, and I paid $50 for the keyboard and mouse, and I do like it, so I'm happy.Only other issue here would be the mouse that comes with this...it is very small, very thin, and low profile. It is much too small for my preferences on how I want my mouse to feel, so I will continue to use my logitech M525 mouse happily. I think a lot of people will probably like the mouse though, and I read that a lot of people compare it to an apple mouse design, since its so small and sleek. It is ultra-quiet, you almost can't hear the clicks at all, so as long as it's not too small for your hands,  you'll probably love using it.So in short, if you'd like a thin and quiet keyboard with a number pad, soft, quiet keys that type just like a laptop, this is a very nice design and it seems to be working great right out of the box. I will hope to get many years of great use out of this keyboard, time will tell. Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I hope it was helpful in some way.\n\n", "\n\n  I've only been using this a few days, so my fat fingers are still bumping into one another on the smaller dance floor, but the fact that they don't have so far to travel plays right into their inherent laziness, so that's all good. And I like the board's solid feel and the substantial response of the keys.But why no on/off switch? It didn't occur to the designers that there were lots of potential circumstances where having an always-live keyboard was a bad idea? Let me suggest just one: cats.

I have owned literally dozen of Logitech keyboards and mice. The reason I have stuck with Logitech is the quality. So, recently I bought a M720 / K850 combo set. I love the functionality and multi-device support, but as far as usability: These are the worst Logitech products I have ever owned. The M720 has MAJOR scrolling issues. When I am scrolling, in frictionless mode, which is the only mode I can stand to use, it quite often will scroll backwards up as mcu as half a page after I stop. Other times it will scroll forward a few lines after the wheels stops turning. Sometime I move the mouse and the scroll jumps all over the place. As a coder this is ANNOYING to say the least! It is to the point where I want to throw it through the wall. Unfortunately I am past my 30 return period...Now to the keyboard: It is better than the mouse, but I also have issues with the keyboard not typing the first few characters after I stop typing for a few minutes. I saw there was firmware upgrade what was supposed to fix it. It did not.  This is REALLY annoying when you are on a login screen and end up mistyping the password because of this issue.Then to top it off,  I contacted Logitech support over a week ago about these issue.  No response other than the automated acknowledgement...\n\n", "\n\n  Note:  Many have complained about missing characters when waking up the keyboard.  This is an issue that has been corrected by Logitech in it's firmware.  So now there may be a miniscule delay during the wake up but you won't be missing any characters.  To me this works well and is an acceptable compromise.Note:  Some people have noted there is no \"windows\" key on this keyboard.  It does have a \"start\" key on the lower left which performs the same function.I love this mouse/keyboard set.  Both devices have the ability to connect to 3 separate devices via Bluetooth and have buttons for you to select which device you want to connect to.  For example you could use it to select between a cell phone, laptop or desktop computer.On the keyboard there are 3 white keys labeled 1, 2 and 3.  You simply press the button of the connection you want to be active.On the mouse there is a single button with 1, 2 and 3 labeled above it.  You simply press that button until the connection number you want to use lights up.Both pieces are nice solid components.  The keyboard is very solid and won't move around when you type.  The keyboard has a soft feel but is very comfortable to use for extended periods of time.  The mouse feels good in your hand.\n\n", "\n\n  A product in middle-to late development stage.The features of both the mouse and the kbd are not documented. They are still working on how to use docs. Like there's a square button on top of the mouse. What's it for? Nothing in the site or app that tells you. But it changes the scrolling of the wheel from smooth scrolling to ratcheted (much easier to control)And for information, scrolling on this mouse work the Windows way, not the Apple way (roll it back, scrolls down not up). Though I think you can change that.I normally use a G710+ mechanical lighted keyboard  (though I am NOT a gamer) with an app called Multiplicity to share mouse and kbd between my i7 W10 and my i7 W7 boxes that sit next to each other but using different monitors. That works just fine with a wireless logimouse connected to the receiver in the keyboard on the W10 box. Mouse moves back and forth nicely, keyboard works where the mouse is.This thing is not the same setup. Sort of.It CAN be set using flow to seamlessly go from one winbox to another. Figuring how to do it is not simple: there ARE no docs on this thing! apart from a useless web page and an html installation screen. Logi says they are badgering the docs group to get it out. OK. For now. But they will have to eat a lot of returns because it is so screwed up, I was ready to return it myself last night. Before I got all working today: the key is a late-model version of OSX. Fat did not work with 10.6, BT would not connect (strangely, a logi wireless mouse DID connect with a receiver stuck in a fron usb port. Dunno why).I then put a mac in the pot, an 2008 Mac Pro 3.1, dual 2.8 Xeons. After finally getting it upgraded from snow leopard, 10.6, to El Capitan, 10.11, (you have to be at snow leopard to get to Capitan, otherwise Yosemite. SL is $20 for the DVD at the apple store, I think. More on evil bay), the stuff started to work with the mac USING THE UNIFYING RECEIVER installed in a usb port in the mac (not the same receiver in the windows boxes). Did not work with Snow Leopard. Wrong version of BT, I guess. But no BT now!!There is mac software that needs to be installed for this stuff. Two pieces: 1 is Logitech Options, I guess you'd call it the drivers, and another is a firmware update for the kbd/mouse and for the receiver. I think if you have run the update on the kbd in Win, you don;t needs to do that in mac. The receiver, though, I think needs updating in each. I suspect there will be other updates in this firmware area.Both the mouse and keyboard have a little switch, or white keys, labelled 1, 2, 3 for computer 1, 2,3 the 3 is for a mac, I guess. I dare not try to change this around to see if mac can be #2 or something, because i have it working now!<G>To go from one # to another you have to flick the switch on both kbd and mouse. The Flow software allows you to not use the switch between Win boxes (maybe mac, too, I don't know. No docs!In general I think it will play out to be useful espectially across platform. But I understand there is software that can do this for less $ than this kit costs.The hardware:All so far is essentially software.The mouse has more buttons and fadgets than I'm comfortable with, but it looks like one can ignore them or learn to use them.,  Overall, I prefer my M510 but so farThe keyboard has fairly large keys with a semi-mushy feel (compared to my mechanical switch G710+). The slightly larger keys do help my non-typist fingers to hit the right key more than not.UPDATE UPDATELogitech has a software called Flow that allows one to move the mouse between up to 3 computers simply by moving it. You need to arrange the computers in a pattern (mine are in line left to right). Installing the software from Logi to my mac, enabled that. Now I can simpl;y moive the mouse from W10 box to mac box \u2026 and keyboard focus goes with it.I'm clicking another star for that!-------Update in early June.I give it more stars, to the max. As I write this both my mac and main W10 box are on their side with innards being revised. New pieces on the way soon. This package is working on the W7 box  without a  hesitation.I am buying another set this week for a Mini and W10 combination in the living room.Hope Logi gets a detailed user manual on this great system pretty soon.Oh, the unified receiver should work on 10.6.8 and up. It does for me. Even if not using the 850 combination package, an M310 mouse works on the mac as well id OS is >latest Snow Leopard.\n\n", "\n\n  This keyboard (a combo packaged with a mouse) is one step forward and several steps back.  The keyboard was designed to accommodate both Windows and Mac operating systems and it fails on Windows \u2013 I cannot comment about its use on Mac machines.First, the documentation is poor \u2013 try to get to the internet to download the documentation when the keyboard does not work!Most of what I read about this keyboard related to technical short-cummings \u2013 the reality is that this keyboard lacks many important features and many important keys' design are poor.There is no dedicated \u201cWindows\u201d key.  It is some odd combination of a start key without a Windows logo key, it is a smaller size than a normal Windows key and its pinned between a function key and an alt key.  This is style over function and it make the keyboard less suitable for a Windows machine.Next, there no dedicated volume up, down or mute keys.  Sound control requires a combination of keystrokes to change volume and an outright terrible overlooked need.  This makes the keyboard worthless for anyone working where the use of a telephone is common.  It is exasperated by the keyboard not being backlit so you have to hunt for the right keystroke combination.As mentioned, the keyboard lacks backlighting \u2013 a very nice feature for working in subdued lighting work spaces which by the way, is common in developed countries.No print screen key \u2013 another design failure.No scroll lock key.The left control key is sub-sized; 87% of Americans are right handed and nearly all use the left control key as dominate.  \u201cControl \u2013 C\u201d or \u201cControl-V\u201d key combinations are now dismal and hard to do with this sub-sized control key.The reason I purchased this was to use it on two computers \u2013 which it does do with all the failures mentioned above.The mouse is average.The downloaded software \u201cLogitech Options\u201d does nothing that Windows 10 already performs.  The downloaded software \u201cMouse and Keyboard Settings\u201d is not much more than software updater and registration to provide snooping data to Logitech.Over the years I have used several Logitech products, and this has been a major, major disappointment.  If you are a Windows user, this is worse than \u201cI cannot recommend this product\u201d my recommendation is \u201cDO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT\u201d.It is incomprehensible to me that since keyboards have been in existence for several decades how Logitech could come up with an absolute terrible design.  This is a huge fail.\n\n", "\n\n  My work setup has two computers tied to two different networks, and I need to switch back and forth between the two throughout the day. I picked this setup because of the bundled laptop/keyboard and for the computer switching ability.- My laptop connects via Bluetooth, and it frequently will stop recognizing the devices such that I have to turn Bluetooth off and on again several times a day; I appreciate not having to dedicate a precious USB port to the dongle, though. The desktop computer connected via the Unifying Receiver doesn't have this problem, but both have a significant delay upon waking even after firmware updates. I wish it came with more than one Unifying Receiver, since it can natively connect to 3 computers simultaneously.- The \"drag and drop across computers\" function only works if you can install the Logitech Options software on both computers AND connect both computers to the same network. If you have a computer without Admin rights to install the program or you can't connect the two to the same wi-fi, this feature will not work.- Switching between computers is easy, though the selector light turns off after a few seconds, so I, with some regularity, start typing for several seconds before realizing the keyboard is connected to a different computer.- Battery life seems fine so far, but it's only been about 2 months. I expect keyboard batteries to last 6-12 months, so we'll see how that goes.- Some have complained about cleaning the bottom of the keyboard. It does collect small debris quickly, but I find a microfiber cloth cleans it just fine without any special treatment.TL;DR, it's an okay solution if you have a very specific need.\n\n", "\n\n  I have owned many Logitech products over the years, so I read a few online reviews (in hindsight just trying to get Amazon commissions and must have never bought this piece of crap!). Since I've always had great experiences with Logitech products, I didn't even bother to read the 1-star reviews on this product ...BIG MISTAKE!!THERE IS NO ON/OFF SWITCH FOR THE KEYBOARD!!! WHAAAAAT?!?!?!(No... removing the batteries does not work... using the \"lock\" switch in the upper right on the side does not work)What others have said is true about not being able to pair the keyboard consistently. In my case, I discovered that bluetooth won't work with my BIOS and pre-OS (which is a problem with a secure BIOS password!!). So, I figured that I would use the USB and at least get booted and have the option to switch to bluetooth when I need the USB slot. Nope! On reboot, even the USB wouldn't allow me to type. Had to switch BACK to my old keyboard and mouse to get back in. After spending an hour trying to pair both the keyboard and mouse to one of my other Logitech unifying receivers, I learned from searching reviews, that there really is NO WAY TO PAIR THE KEYBOARD BECAUSE IT HAS NO ON/OFF SWITCH!! I thought \"NO... can't be... they couldn't have released this product without a way to pair it\", but they did. Even though the keyboard is already paired to the unifying receiver that came with it, on reboot, I found that it didn't work.Absolute trash, this is. Did some crap company buy out Logitech?? They should be ashamed for this junk!!\n\n", "\n\n  The Logitech MK850 keyboard does not have a ON/OFF switch which is REQUIRED for the Logitech Unifying Software to connect the MK850 to a Unifying Receiver. During the initial installation of my MK850, I was lucky in that it was already paired with the Unifying Receiver (I do not know how Logitech did that.) My MK850 worked fine until today when it lost connection with it's Unifying Receiver. My first thought was to reboot the PC. On reboot the MK850 did not reconnect and I couldn't login to Windows 10 without a keyboard. Luckily I had an old keyboard that I managed to connect and could therefore login to Windows 10. I then spent 2.5 hours trying to get the MK850 to pair with it's Unifying Receiver!! Very frustrating! And I almost gave up when, suddenly, it paired. I still don't know exactly what I did to get it to pair. It's as if it was just an accident. ... Secondly: fnF9 and fnF10 are used on the MK850 to control the speaker volume. But if you accidentally go all the way to max speaker volume or to min speaker volume with these keys, the MK850 locks the volume at that level and you cannot change it after that. The only solution is to reboot the PC. Thirdly: There is no MK850 manual or set of instructions in existence and the MK850 support for this keyboard at Logitech.com is completely nonexistent. If something goes wrong, there is no help. You have to figure it out for yourself. ... I can live with the volume thing since I now know how it works. But if my MK850 ever disconnects from the Unifying Receiver again, I'll dump it.\n\n", "\n\n  I use this in an office setting and I am quite pleased.Pros:The 'quick-switch' software to go back on forth between two pc's easilyBattery LifeEast of install (Bluetooth on my two computers)Mouse is fully programmableFair price for what you getCons:Yes, the sleep delay mentioned in some reviews is there but it is minor and you get used to it quicklyI wish it were back-lit, but you can't have everything\n\n", "\n\n  Pros1) Multi-device feature is awesome.  I have my desktop, laptop, and smart TV connected.  You will have to buy some more universal Logitech dongles since it only comes with one.  I was very frustrated at first with the setup, but got a tip from user community that you MUST USE A WIRED MOUSE to setup the multi-device feature.  Once it is setup, you can switch devices simply by pushing a bottom on the keyboard and mouse.2) Ergonomics is a plus. Slightly curved upward in the middle makes it a little easier on the hands and wrist.3) Deep-stroke keys. It's a preference for me.  I'm a pounder.4) Battery: They say it will go for 3 years on two AA's.  We'll see.  So far no issues. after 6 months5) Apple keys - I don't know how to use them or turn them on, but they are there.Cons1) No instruction manual.  No online manual.  The software that you have to download does explain a few of the function keys, but not all of them.2) No Print Screen (PrtSc) key.  I did finally figure out that there is a camera key, but again there is no manual.  Only figured this out after searching User Community.3) Windows Key is not labeled.  Again, consulted User Community and found it, but it's not labeled.Logitech should have created a manual for this keyboard and at least posted it on it's website.3)\n\n", "\n\n  Had the MX series for .. well .. ever, until the mouse clicker started misbehaving - that and I had to use a USB switcher to switch between work and home computers (I work from home). This guy .. now this guy is perfect. The 1-2-3 button on the keyboard and mouse, which are independent from each other, are fantastic. At first I thought it was annoying - why on earth would I want my mouse on one computer and my keyboard on the other -- ohh, but I DO I DO ... kick off a play list/netflix/something on my personal while merrily writing up a doc on work. It's great!!My biggest suggestion is to NOT use bluetooth. I think it sucks too much battery, and is much slower to connect, and often - especially with Mac - doesn't always make the connection. My work computer has a pre-boot password (bit-locker thing) so can't use bluetooth with it. With the universal USB - it's INSTANT workie workie happie happie go go go. Works pre-boot every time, and I'm convinced it uses less battery as well.Even tho the keyboard is louder -- not quite old IBM bashie bashie keyboard loud, but maybe close -- it FEELS GOOD. It's nice and responsive. Not soft and squishy did I press the key at all? The mouse is not as big as the MX850 (I think that's what I had) - but it's a good size, feels nice in my average girl sized hand. The device switcher button on the mouse does not get in the way of normal use.The feature I do not use is Flow. Flow is this handy-dandy-feature that allows you to mouse over to the side of your screen and it'll auto switch (I think just the mouse) to the other computer). In theory it seems nice - but I think my setup confuses it. I have a Mac and a PC and both of them share a monitor - during work hours my work laptop uses it, then off hours I manually switch the monitor (using monitor menu) to my mac -- so trying to use flow it sorta gets lost on the mac and I can't get it to switch back - probably because it can't actually get to that side of the screen. But, it's really not a must have feature to me. I'm too controlly that way.I like that the keyboard has both windows, mac, laptop labels on the buttons .. example: one button has start/alt/opt, another has alt/cmd/apple .. has the fn keys too. Makes using it very handy for my apple handicapped hubby. Because it has laptop fn keys some standard keystrokes need modifcations, but it's easy ... like print screen is fn+insert (has camera icon) .. and limited print screen is ctrl+fn+insert .. but they're all close so easy -- little tweaks in the day of the life.Have I mentioned I really do like this keyboard/mouse? yes, yes I do. you might too. :)All in all two hearty thumbs up. Really great replacement for my previous Logitech, I didn't think it could get better - and this is definitely better.\n\n", "\n\n  First off, I have been a long time, loyal Logitech user. I have owned literally dozen of Logitech keyboards and mice. The reason I have stuck with Logitech is the quality. So, recently I bought a M720 / K850 combo set. I love the functionality and multi-device support, but as far as usability: These are the worst Logitech products I have ever owned. The M720 has MAJOR scrolling issues. When I am scrolling, in frictionless mode, which is the only mode I can stand to use, it quite often will scroll backwards up as mcu as half a page after I stop. Other times it will scroll forward a few lines after the wheels stops turning. Sometime I move the mouse and the scroll jumps all over the place. As a coder this is ANNOYING to say the least! It is to the point where I want to throw it through the wall. Unfortunately I am past my 30 return period...Now to the keyboard: It is better than the mouse, but I also have issues with the keyboard not typing the first few characters after I stop typing for a few minutes. I saw there was firmware upgrade what was supposed to fix it. It did not.  This is REALLY annoying when you are on a login screen and end up mistyping the password because of this issue.Then to top it off,  I contacted Logitech support over a week ago about these issue.  No response other than the automated acknowledgement...\n\n", "\n\n  Note:  Many have complained about missing characters when waking up the keyboard.  This is an issue that has been corrected by Logitech in it's firmware.  So now there may be a miniscule delay during the wake up but you won't be missing any characters.  To me this works well and is an acceptable compromise.Note:  Some people have noted there is no \"windows\" key on this keyboard.  It does have a \"start\" key on the lower left which performs the same function.I love this mouse/keyboard set.  Both devices have the ability to connect to 3 separate devices via Bluetooth and have buttons for you to select which device you want to connect to.  For example you could use it to select between a cell phone, laptop or desktop computer.On the keyboard there are 3 white keys labeled 1, 2 and 3.  You simply press the button of the connection you want to be active.On the mouse there is a single button with 1, 2 and 3 labeled above it.  You simply press that button until the connection number you want to use lights up.Both pieces are nice solid components.  The keyboard is very solid and won't move around when you type.  The keyboard has a soft feel but is very comfortable to use for extended periods of time.  The mouse feels good in your hand.\n\n", "\n\n  A product in middle-to late development stage.The features of both the mouse and the kbd are not documented. They are still working on how to use docs. Like there's a square button on top of the mouse. What's it for? Nothing in the site or app that tells you. But it changes the scrolling of the wheel from smooth scrolling to ratcheted (much easier to control)And for information, scrolling on this mouse work the Windows way, not the Apple way (roll it back, scrolls down not up). Though I think you can change that.I normally use a G710+ mechanical lighted keyboard  (though I am NOT a gamer) with an app called Multiplicity to share mouse and kbd between my i7 W10 and my i7 W7 boxes that sit next to each other but using different monitors. That works just fine with a wireless logimouse connected to the receiver in the keyboard on the W10 box. Mouse moves back and forth nicely, keyboard works where the mouse is.This thing is not the same setup. Sort of.It CAN be set using flow to seamlessly go from one winbox to another. Figuring how to do it is not simple: there ARE no docs on this thing! apart from a useless web page and an html installation screen. Logi says they are badgering the docs group to get it out. OK. For now. But they will have to eat a lot of returns because it is so screwed up, I was ready to return it myself last night. Before I got all working today: the key is a late-model version of OSX. Fat did not work with 10.6, BT would not connect (strangely, a logi wireless mouse DID connect with a receiver stuck in a fron usb port. Dunno why).I then put a mac in the pot, an 2008 Mac Pro 3.1, dual 2.8 Xeons. After finally getting it upgraded from snow leopard, 10.6, to El Capitan, 10.11, (you have to be at snow leopard to get to Capitan, otherwise Yosemite. SL is $20 for the DVD at the apple store, I think. More on evil bay), the stuff started to work with the mac USING THE UNIFYING RECEIVER installed in a usb port in the mac (not the same receiver in the windows boxes). Did not work with Snow Leopard. Wrong version of BT, I guess. But no BT now!!There is mac software that needs to be installed for this stuff. Two pieces: 1 is Logitech Options, I guess you'd call it the drivers, and another is a firmware update for the kbd/mouse and for the receiver. I think if you have run the update on the kbd in Win, you don;t needs to do that in mac. The receiver, though, I think needs updating in each. I suspect there will be other updates in this firmware area.Both the mouse and keyboard have a little switch, or white keys, labelled 1, 2, 3 for computer 1, 2,3 the 3 is for a mac, I guess. I dare not try to change this around to see if mac can be #2 or something, because i have it working now!<G>To go from one # to another you have to flick the switch on both kbd and mouse. The Flow software allows you to not use the switch between Win boxes (maybe mac, too, I don't know. No docs!In general I think it will play out to be useful espectially across platform. But I understand there is software that can do this for less $ than this kit costs.The hardware:All so far is essentially software.The mouse has more buttons and fadgets than I'm comfortable with, but it looks like one can ignore them or learn to use them.,  Overall, I prefer my M510 but so farThe keyboard has fairly large keys with a semi-mushy feel (compared to my mechanical switch G710+). The slightly larger keys do help my non-typist fingers to hit the right key more than not.UPDATE UPDATELogitech has a software called Flow that allows one to move the mouse between up to 3 computers simply by moving it. You need to arrange the computers in a pattern (mine are in line left to right). Installing the software from Logi to my mac, enabled that. Now I can simpl;y moive the mouse from W10 box to mac box \u2026 and keyboard focus goes with it.I'm clicking another star for that!-------Update in early June.I give it more stars, to the max. As I write this both my mac and main W10 box are on their side with innards being revised. New pieces on the way soon. This package is working on the W7 box  without a  hesitation.I am buying another set this week for a Mini and W10 combination in the living room.Hope Logi gets a detailed user manual on this great system pretty soon.Oh, the unified receiver should work on 10.6.8 and up. It does for me. Even if not using the 850 combination package, an M310 mouse works on the mac as well id OS is >latest Snow Leopard.\n\n", "\n\n  This keyboard (a combo packaged with a mouse) is one step forward and several steps back.  The keyboard was designed to accommodate both Windows and Mac operating systems and it fails on Windows \u2013 I cannot comment about its use on Mac machines.First, the documentation is poor \u2013 try to get to the internet to download the documentation when the keyboard does not work!Most of what I read about this keyboard related to technical short-cummings \u2013 the reality is that this keyboard lacks many important features and many important keys' design are poor.There is no dedicated \u201cWindows\u201d key.  It is some odd combination of a start key without a Windows logo key, it is a smaller size than a normal Windows key and its pinned between a function key and an alt key.  This is style over function and it make the keyboard less suitable for a Windows machine.Next, there no dedicated volume up, down or mute keys.  Sound control requires a combination of keystrokes to change volume and an outright terrible overlooked need.  This makes the keyboard worthless for anyone working where the use of a telephone is common.  It is exasperated by the keyboard not being backlit so you have to hunt for the right keystroke combination.As mentioned, the keyboard lacks backlighting \u2013 a very nice feature for working in subdued lighting work spaces which by the way, is common in developed countries.No print screen key \u2013 another design failure.No scroll lock key.The left control key is sub-sized; 87% of Americans are right handed and nearly all use the left control key as dominate.  \u201cControl \u2013 C\u201d or \u201cControl-V\u201d key combinations are now dismal and hard to do with this sub-sized control key.The reason I purchased this was to use it on two computers \u2013 which it does do with all the failures mentioned above.The mouse is average.The downloaded software \u201cLogitech Options\u201d does nothing that Windows 10 already performs.  The downloaded software \u201cMouse and Keyboard Settings\u201d is not much more than software updater and registration to provide snooping data to Logitech.Over the years I have used several Logitech products, and this has been a major, major disappointment.  If you are a Windows user, this is worse than \u201cI cannot recommend this product\u201d my recommendation is \u201cDO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT\u201d.It is incomprehensible to me that since keyboards have been in existence for several decades how Logitech could come up with an absolute terrible design.  This is a huge fail.\n\n", "\n\n  My work setup has two computers tied to two different networks, and I need to switch back and forth between the two throughout the day. I picked this setup because of the bundled laptop/keyboard and for the computer switching ability.- My laptop connects via Bluetooth, and it frequently will stop recognizing the devices such that I have to turn Bluetooth off and on again several times a day; I appreciate not having to dedicate a precious USB port to the dongle, though. The desktop computer connected via the Unifying Receiver doesn't have this problem, but both have a significant delay upon waking even after firmware updates. I wish it came with more than one Unifying Receiver, since it can natively connect to 3 computers simultaneously.- The \"drag and drop across computers\" function only works if you can install the Logitech Options software on both computers AND connect both computers to the same network. If you have a computer without Admin rights to install the program or you can't connect the two to the same wi-fi, this feature will not work.- Switching between computers is easy, though the selector light turns off after a few seconds, so I, with some regularity, start typing for several seconds before realizing the keyboard is connected to a different computer.- Battery life seems fine so far, but it's only been about 2 months. I expect keyboard batteries to last 6-12 months, so we'll see how that goes.- Some have complained about cleaning the bottom of the keyboard. It does collect small debris quickly, but I find a microfiber cloth cleans it just fine without any special treatment.TL;DR, it's an okay solution if you have a very specific need.\n\n", "\n\n  I have owned many Logitech products over the years, so I read a few online reviews (in hindsight just trying to get Amazon commissions and must have never bought this piece of crap!). Since I've always had great experiences with Logitech products, I didn't even bother to read the 1-star reviews on this product ...BIG MISTAKE!!THERE IS NO ON/OFF SWITCH FOR THE KEYBOARD!!! WHAAAAAT?!?!?!(No... removing the batteries does not work... using the \"lock\" switch in the upper right on the side does not work)What others have said is true about not being able to pair the keyboard consistently. In my case, I discovered that bluetooth won't work with my BIOS and pre-OS (which is a problem with a secure BIOS password!!). So, I figured that I would use the USB and at least get booted and have the option to switch to bluetooth when I need the USB slot. Nope! On reboot, even the USB wouldn't allow me to type. Had to switch BACK to my old keyboard and mouse to get back in. After spending an hour trying to pair both the keyboard and mouse to one of my other Logitech unifying receivers, I learned from searching reviews, that there really is NO WAY TO PAIR THE KEYBOARD BECAUSE IT HAS NO ON/OFF SWITCH!! I thought \"NO... can't be... they couldn't have released this product without a way to pair it\", but they did. Even though the keyboard is already paired to the unifying receiver that came with it, on reboot, I found that it didn't work.Absolute trash, this is. Did some crap company buy out Logitech?? They should be ashamed for this junk!!\n\n", "\n\n  The Logitech MK850 keyboard does not have a ON/OFF switch which is REQUIRED for the Logitech Unifying Software to connect the MK850 to a Unifying Receiver. During the initial installation of my MK850, I was lucky in that it was already paired with the Unifying Receiver (I do not know how Logitech did that.) My MK850 worked fine until today when it lost connection with it's Unifying Receiver. My first thought was to reboot the PC. On reboot the MK850 did not reconnect and I couldn't login to Windows 10 without a keyboard. Luckily I had an old keyboard that I managed to connect and could therefore login to Windows 10. I then spent 2.5 hours trying to get the MK850 to pair with it's Unifying Receiver!! Very frustrating! And I almost gave up when, suddenly, it paired. I still don't know exactly what I did to get it to pair. It's as if it was just an accident. ... Secondly: fnF9 and fnF10 are used on the MK850 to control the speaker volume. But if you accidentally go all the way to max speaker volume or to min speaker volume with these keys, the MK850 locks the volume at that level and you cannot change it after that. The only solution is to reboot the PC. Thirdly: There is no MK850 manual or set of instructions in existence and the MK850 support for this keyboard at Logitech.com is completely nonexistent. If something goes wrong, there is no help. You have to figure it out for yourself. ... I can live with the volume thing since I now know how it works. But if my MK850 ever disconnects from the Unifying Receiver again, I'll dump it.\n\n", "\n\n  I use this in an office setting and I am quite pleased.Pros:The 'quick-switch' software to go back on forth between two pc's easilyBattery LifeEast of install (Bluetooth on my two computers)Mouse is fully programmableFair price for what you getCons:Yes, the sleep delay mentioned in some reviews is there but it is minor and you get used to it quicklyI wish it were back-lit, but you can't have everything\n\n", "\n\n  Pros1) Multi-device feature is awesome.  I have my desktop, laptop, and smart TV connected.  You will have to buy some more universal Logitech dongles since it only comes with one.  I was very frustrated at first with the setup, but got a tip from user community that you MUST USE A WIRED MOUSE to setup the multi-device feature.  Once it is setup, you can switch devices simply by pushing a bottom on the keyboard and mouse.2) Ergonomics is a plus. Slightly curved upward in the middle makes it a little easier on the hands and wrist.3) Deep-stroke keys. It's a preference for me.  I'm a pounder.4) Battery: They say it will go for 3 years on two AA's.  We'll see.  So far no issues. after 6 months5) Apple keys - I don't know how to use them or turn them on, but they are there.Cons1) No instruction manual.  No online manual.  The software that you have to download does explain a few of the function keys, but not all of them.2) No Print Screen (PrtSc) key.

I picked this setup because of the bundled laptop/keyboard and for the computer switching ability.- My laptop connects via Bluetooth, and it frequently will stop recognizing the devices such that I have to turn Bluetooth off and on again several times a day; I appreciate not having to dedicate a precious USB port to the dongle, though. The desktop computer connected via the Unifying Receiver doesn't have this problem, but both have a significant delay upon waking even after firmware updates. I wish it came with more than one Unifying Receiver, since it can natively connect to 3 computers simultaneously.- The \"drag and drop across computers\" function only works if you can install the Logitech Options software on both computers AND connect both computers to the same network. If you have a computer without Admin rights to install the program or you can't connect the two to the same wi-fi, this feature will not work.- Switching between computers is easy, though the selector light turns off after a few seconds, so I, with some regularity, start typing for several seconds before realizing the keyboard is connected to a different computer.- Battery life seems fine so far, but it's only been about 2 months. I expect keyboard batteries to last 6-12 months, so we'll see how that goes.- Some have complained about cleaning the bottom of the keyboard. It does collect small debris quickly, but I find a microfiber cloth cleans it just fine without any special treatment.TL;DR, it's an okay solution if you have a very specific need.\n\n", "\n\n  I have owned many Logitech products over the years, so I read a few online reviews (in hindsight just trying to get Amazon commissions and must have never bought this piece of crap!). Since I've always had great experiences with Logitech products, I didn't even bother to read the 1-star reviews on this product ...BIG MISTAKE!!THERE IS NO ON/OFF SWITCH FOR THE KEYBOARD!!! WHAAAAAT?!?!?!(No... removing the batteries does not work... using the \"lock\" switch in the upper right on the side does not work)What others have said is true about not being able to pair the keyboard consistently. In my case, I discovered that bluetooth won't work with my BIOS and pre-OS (which is a problem with a secure BIOS password!!). So, I figured that I would use the USB and at least get booted and have the option to switch to bluetooth when I need the USB slot. Nope! On reboot, even the USB wouldn't allow me to type. Had to switch BACK to my old keyboard and mouse to get back in. After spending an hour trying to pair both the keyboard and mouse to one of my other Logitech unifying receivers, I learned from searching reviews, that there really is NO WAY TO PAIR THE KEYBOARD BECAUSE IT HAS NO ON/OFF SWITCH!! I thought \"NO... can't be... they couldn't have released this product without a way to pair it\", but they did. Even though the keyboard is already paired to the unifying receiver that came with it, on reboot, I found that it didn't work.Absolute trash, this is. Did some crap company buy out Logitech?? They should be ashamed for this junk!!\n\n", "\n\n  The Logitech MK850 keyboard does not have a ON/OFF switch which is REQUIRED for the Logitech Unifying Software to connect the MK850 to a Unifying Receiver. During the initial installation of my MK850, I was lucky in that it was already paired with the Unifying Receiver (I do not know how Logitech did that.) My MK850 worked fine until today when it lost connection with it's Unifying Receiver. My first thought was to reboot the PC. On reboot the MK850 did not reconnect and I couldn't login to Windows 10 without a keyboard. Luckily I had an old keyboard that I managed to connect and could therefore login to Windows 10. I then spent 2.5 hours trying to get the MK850 to pair with it's Unifying Receiver!! Very frustrating! And I almost gave up when, suddenly, it paired. I still don't know exactly what I did to get it to pair. It's as if it was just an accident. ... Secondly: fnF9 and fnF10 are used on the MK850 to control the speaker volume. But if you accidentally go all the way to max speaker volume or to min speaker volume with these keys, the MK850 locks the volume at that level and you cannot change it after that. The only solution is to reboot the PC. Thirdly: There is no MK850 manual or set of instructions in existence and the MK850 support for this keyboard at Logitech.com is completely nonexistent. If something goes wrong, there is no help. You have to figure it out for yourself. ... I can live with the volume thing since I now know how it works. But if my MK850 ever disconnects from the Unifying Receiver again, I'll dump it.\n\n", "\n\n  I use this in an office setting and I am quite pleased.Pros:The 'quick-switch' software to go back on forth between two pc's easilyBattery LifeEast of install (Bluetooth on my two computers)Mouse is fully programmableFair price for what you getCons:Yes, the sleep delay mentioned in some reviews is there but it is minor and you get used to it quicklyI wish it were back-lit, but you can't have everything\n\n", "\n\n  Pros1) Multi-device feature is awesome.  I have my desktop, laptop, and smart TV connected.  You will have to buy some more universal Logitech dongles since it only comes with one.  I was very frustrated at first with the setup, but got a tip from user community that you MUST USE A WIRED MOUSE to setup the multi-device feature.  Once it is setup, you can switch devices simply by pushing a bottom on the keyboard and mouse.2) Ergonomics is a plus. Slightly curved upward in the middle makes it a little easier on the hands and wrist.3) Deep-stroke keys. It's a preference for me.  I'm a pounder.4) Battery: They say it will go for 3 years on two AA's.  We'll see.  So far no issues. after 6 months5) Apple keys - I don't know how to use them or turn them on, but they are there.Cons1) No instruction manual.  No online manual.  The software that you have to download does explain a few of the function keys, but not all of them.2) No Print Screen (PrtSc) key.  I did finally figure out that there is a camera key, but again there is no manual.  Only figured this out after searching User Community.3) Windows Key is not labeled.  Again, consulted User Community and found it, but it's not labeled.Logitech should have created a manual for this keyboard and at least posted it on it's website.3)\n\n", "\n\n  Had the MX series for .. well .. ever, until the mouse clicker started misbehaving - that and I had to use a USB switcher to switch between work and home computers (I work from home). This guy .. now this guy is perfect. The 1-2-3 button on the keyboard and mouse, which are independent from each other, are fantastic. At first I thought it was annoying - why on earth would I want my mouse on one computer and my keyboard on the other -- ohh, but I DO I DO ... kick off a play list/netflix/something on my personal while merrily writing up a doc on work. It's great!!My biggest suggestion is to NOT use bluetooth. I think it sucks too much battery, and is much slower to connect, and often - especially with Mac - doesn't always make the connection. My work computer has a pre-boot password (bit-locker thing) so can't use bluetooth with it. With the universal USB - it's INSTANT workie workie happie happie go go go. Works pre-boot every time, and I'm convinced it uses less battery as well.Even tho the keyboard is louder -- not quite old IBM bashie bashie keyboard loud, but maybe close -- it FEELS GOOD. It's nice and responsive. Not soft and squishy did I press the key at all? The mouse is not as big as the MX850 (I think that's what I had) - but it's a good size, feels nice in my average girl sized hand. The device switcher button on the mouse does not get in the way of normal use.The feature I do not use is Flow. Flow is this handy-dandy-feature that allows you to mouse over to the side of your screen and it'll auto switch (I think just the mouse) to the other computer). In theory it seems nice - but I think my setup confuses it. I have a Mac and a PC and both of them share a monitor - during work hours my work laptop uses it, then off hours I manually switch the monitor (using monitor menu) to my mac -- so trying to use flow it sorta gets lost on the mac and I can't get it to switch back - probably because it can't actually get to that side of the screen. But, it's really not a must have feature to me. I'm too controlly that way.I like that the keyboard has both windows, mac, laptop labels on the buttons .. example: one button has start/alt/opt, another has alt/cmd/apple .. has the fn keys too. Makes using it very handy for my apple handicapped hubby. Because it has laptop fn keys some standard keystrokes need modifcations, but it's easy ... like print screen is fn+insert (has camera icon) .. and limited print screen is ctrl+fn+insert .. but they're all close so easy -- little tweaks in the day of the life.Have I mentioned I really do like this keyboard/mouse? yes, yes I do. you might too. :)All in all two hearty thumbs up. Really great replacement for my previous Logitech, I didn't think it could get better - and this is definitely better.\n\n", "\n\n  First off, I have been a long time, loyal Logitech user. I have owned literally dozen of Logitech keyboards and mice. The reason I have stuck with Logitech is the quality. So, recently I bought a M720 / K850 combo set. I love the functionality and multi-device support, but as far as usability: These are the worst Logitech products I have ever owned. The M720 has MAJOR scrolling issues. When I am scrolling, in frictionless mode, which is the only mode I can stand to use, it quite often will scroll backwards up as mcu as half a page after I stop. Other times it will scroll forward a few lines after the wheels stops turning. Sometime I move the mouse and the scroll jumps all over the place. As a coder this is ANNOYING to say the least! It is to the point where I want to throw it through the wall. Unfortunately I am past my 30 return period...Now to the keyboard: It is better than the mouse, but I also have issues with the keyboard not typing the first few characters after I stop typing for a few minutes. I saw there was firmware upgrade what was supposed to fix it. It did not.  This is REALLY annoying when you are on a login screen and end up mistyping the password because of this issue.Then to top it off,  I contacted Logitech support over a week ago about these issue.  No response other than the automated acknowledgement...\n\n", "\n\n  Note:  Many have complained about missing characters when waking up the keyboard.  This is an issue that has been corrected by Logitech in it's firmware.  So now there may be a miniscule delay during the wake up but you won't be missing any characters.  To me this works well and is an acceptable compromise.Note:  Some people have noted there is no \"windows\" key on this keyboard.  It does have a \"start\" key on the lower left which performs the same function.I love this mouse/keyboard set.  Both devices have the ability to connect to 3 separate devices via Bluetooth and have buttons for you to select which device you want to connect to.  For example you could use it to select between a cell phone, laptop or desktop computer.On the keyboard there are 3 white keys labeled 1, 2 and 3.  You simply press the button of the connection you want to be active.On the mouse there is a single button with 1, 2 and 3 labeled above it.  You simply press that button until the connection number you want to use lights up.Both pieces are nice solid components.  The keyboard is very solid and won't move around when you type.  The keyboard has a soft feel but is very comfortable to use for extended periods of time.  The mouse feels good in your hand.\n\n", "\n\n  A product in middle-to late development stage.The features of both the mouse and the kbd are not documented. They are still working on how to use docs. Like there's a square button on top of the mouse. What's it for? Nothing in the site or app that tells you. But it changes the scrolling of the wheel from smooth scrolling to ratcheted (much easier to control)And for information, scrolling on this mouse work the Windows way, not the Apple way (roll it back, scrolls down not up). Though I think you can change that.I normally use a G710+ mechanical lighted keyboard  (though I am NOT a gamer) with an app called Multiplicity to share mouse and kbd between my i7 W10 and my i7 W7 boxes that sit next to each other but using different monitors. That works just fine with a wireless logimouse connected to the receiver in the keyboard on the W10 box. Mouse moves back and forth nicely, keyboard works where the mouse is.This thing is not the same setup. Sort of.It CAN be set using flow to seamlessly go from one winbox to another. Figuring how to do it is not simple: there ARE no docs on this thing! apart from a useless web page and an html installation screen. Logi says they are badgering the docs group to get it out. OK. For now. But they will have to eat a lot of returns because it is so screwed up, I was ready to return it myself last night. Before I got all working today: the key is a late-model version of OSX. Fat did not work with 10.6, BT would not connect (strangely, a logi wireless mouse DID connect with a receiver stuck in a fron usb port. Dunno why).I then put a mac in the pot, an 2008 Mac Pro 3.1, dual 2.8 Xeons. After finally getting it upgraded from snow leopard, 10.6, to El Capitan, 10.11, (you have to be at snow leopard to get to Capitan, otherwise Yosemite. SL is $20 for the DVD at the apple store, I think. More on evil bay), the stuff started to work with the mac USING THE UNIFYING RECEIVER installed in a usb port in the mac (not the same receiver in the windows boxes). Did not work with Snow Leopard. Wrong version of BT, I guess. But no BT now!!There is mac software that needs to be installed for this stuff. Two pieces: 1 is Logitech Options, I guess you'd call it the drivers, and another is a firmware update for the kbd/mouse and for the receiver. I think if you have run the update on the kbd in Win, you don;t needs to do that in mac. The receiver, though, I think needs updating in each. I suspect there will be other updates in this firmware area.Both the mouse and keyboard have a little switch, or white keys, labelled 1, 2, 3 for computer 1, 2,3 the 3 is for a mac, I guess. I dare not try to change this around to see if mac can be #2 or something, because i have it working now!<G>To go from one # to another you have to flick the switch on both kbd and mouse. The Flow software allows you to not use the switch between Win boxes (maybe mac, too, I don't know. No docs!In general I think it will play out to be useful espectially across platform. But I understand there is software that can do this for less $ than this kit costs.The hardware:All so far is essentially software.The mouse has more buttons and fadgets than I'm comfortable with, but it looks like one can ignore them or learn to use them.,  Overall, I prefer my M510 but so farThe keyboard has fairly large keys with a semi-mushy feel (compared to my mechanical switch G710+). The slightly larger keys do help my non-typist fingers to hit the right key more than not.UPDATE UPDATELogitech has a software called Flow that allows one to move the mouse between up to 3 computers simply by moving it. You need to arrange the computers in a pattern (mine are in line left to right). Installing the software from Logi to my mac, enabled that. Now I can simpl;y moive the mouse from W10 box to mac box \u2026 and keyboard focus goes with it.I'm clicking another star for that!-------Update in early June.I give it more stars, to the max. As I write this both my mac and main W10 box are on their side with innards being revised. New pieces on the way soon. This package is working on the W7 box  without a  hesitation.I am buying another set this week for a Mini and W10 combination in the living room.Hope Logi gets a detailed user manual on this great system pretty soon.Oh, the unified receiver should work on 10.6.8 and up. It does for me. Even if not using the 850 combination package, an M310 mouse works on the mac as well id OS is >latest Snow Leopard.\n\n", "\n\n  This keyboard (a combo packaged with a mouse) is one step forward and several steps back.  The keyboard was designed to accommodate both Windows and Mac operating systems and it fails on Windows \u2013 I cannot comment about its use on Mac machines.First, the documentation is poor \u2013 try to get to the internet to download the documentation when the keyboard does not work!Most of what I read about this keyboard related to technical short-cummings \u2013 the reality is that this keyboard lacks many important features and many important keys' design are poor.There is no dedicated \u201cWindows\u201d key.  It is some odd combination of a start key without a Windows logo key, it is a smaller size than a normal Windows key and its pinned between a function key and an alt key.  This is style over function and it make the keyboard less suitable for a Windows machine.Next, there no dedicated volume up, down or mute keys.  Sound control requires a combination of keystrokes to change volume and an outright terrible overlooked need.  This makes the keyboard worthless for anyone working where the use of a telephone is common.  It is exasperated by the keyboard not being backlit so you have to hunt for the right keystroke combination.As mentioned, the keyboard lacks backlighting \u2013 a very nice feature for working in subdued lighting work spaces which by the way, is common in developed countries.No print screen key \u2013 another design failure.No scroll lock key.The left control key is sub-sized; 87% of Americans are right handed and nearly all use the left control key as dominate.  \u201cControl \u2013 C\u201d or \u201cControl-V\u201d key combinations are now dismal and hard to do with this sub-sized control key.The reason I purchased this was to use it on two computers \u2013 which it does do with all the failures mentioned above.The mouse is average.The downloaded software \u201cLogitech Options\u201d does nothing that Windows 10 already performs.  The downloaded software \u201cMouse and Keyboard Settings\u201d is not much more than software updater and registration to provide snooping data to Logitech.Over the years I have used several Logitech products, and this has been a major, major disappointment.  If you are a Windows user, this is worse than \u201cI cannot recommend this product\u201d my recommendation is \u201cDO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT\u201d.It is incomprehensible to me that since keyboards have been in existence for several decades how Logitech could come up with an absolute terrible design.

Not just because they're often insanely overpriced, but also because when Apple steps out of its core competency, quality takes a beating.Especially keyboards! Them puppies are as pretty as can be, but more fragile than D Trump's ego. One time a single drop of sweat rolled off my forehead and landed on my keyboard. The whole thing short circuited, sirens went off, and the ghost of Steve Jobs reached thru the screen and began rifling thru my pockets for $200 bucks.Anyway, this keyboard is great. The keys are light to the touch, responsive, do as told. I'm a fast typer, this keyboard does not slow me down. As a writer, I prefer keyboards/mice that plug in so that I don't lose momentum by being forced to go searching for batteries, right in the middle of a hot streak.Haven't tried the mouse yet, plan to keep it as a spare.This keyboard is not fancy, but it's cheap, works well, and does the trick. I also have the Logitech K120 and have been using it for years on another Mac with zero issues. The K120 is even cheaper, but it lacks the media buttons on top (volume up, volume down, etc). That's kind of annoying, hence the reason I bumped up to K200 this time.FOR APPLE USERS:Yes, the MK200 will work for you... even the volume buttons. When you plug it in the first time, a message will appear on the screen saying your computer needs some help recognizing it. All you have to do is press the buttons it asks you to press and then you can use it. Quick and easy!If you want the modifier buttons on the MK200 to work exactly as your old keyboard, you will have to swap the positions of the Command and Option keys.To do that:1. Open \"System Preferences\"2. Click \"Keyboard\"3. Click \"Modifier Keys\"4. Change (see attached screenshot):---- Option Key to Command---- Command Key to OptionAfter that, all your quick key shortcuts will work as they did on your Apple keyboard.Hope that helps!UPDATE: Today is August 12, 2020... almost 3 years to the day since I bought this keyboard. I returned to this page so that I could buy another one for a dif computer. Since I was here, I thought I should go ahead and update my review. The original keyboard? I'm *still* using it!\n\n", "\n\n  This combo has a nice design.  The keyboard doesn't mess with tradition, putting all keys where they belong (and the calculator button's a nice touch).  The mouse is a proper size/height and has a good scroll wheel.  Tactile satisfaction is good, and $20 is fair.But I've bought THREE of these MK200 combos over the past year, and each had a major flaw.  On the first combo, the keyboard's spacebar was wonky, only working when pressed in a certain spot.  On the second, the mouse wheel was stiff and imprecise.  So I exchanged it for this third combo that was fine at first, but now three months in, the keyboard is acting up strangely.  When I press Shift + a letter key, one of the two just doesn't register sometimes, causing frequent typos; the number pad's Enter key also cuts in and out on a whim.  If that's not enough, the mouse is starting to register single clicks as double-clicks, making the whole affair a glitchfest concerto.If my math is correct, 3 out of 3 samples konking out calculates to a failure rate of 100%.

I also have the Logitech K120 and have been using it for years on another Mac with zero issues. The K120 is even cheaper, but it lacks the media buttons on top (volume up, volume down, etc). That's kind of annoying, hence the reason I bumped up to K200 this time.FOR APPLE USERS:Yes, the MK200 will work for you... even the volume buttons. When you plug it in the first time, a message will appear on the screen saying your computer needs some help recognizing it. All you have to do is press the buttons it asks you to press and then you can use it. Quick and easy!If you want the modifier buttons on the MK200 to work exactly as your old keyboard, you will have to swap the positions of the Command and Option keys.To do that:1. Open \"System Preferences\"2. Click \"Keyboard\"3. Click \"Modifier Keys\"4. Change (see attached screenshot):---- Option Key to Command---- Command Key to OptionAfter that, all your quick key shortcuts will work as they did on your Apple keyboard.Hope that helps!UPDATE: Today is August 12, 2020... almost 3 years to the day since I bought this keyboard.

The keys are light to the touch, responsive, do as told. I'm a fast typer, this keyboard does not slow me down. As a writer, I prefer keyboards/mice that plug in so that I don't lose momentum by being forced to go searching for batteries, right in the middle of a hot streak.Haven't tried the mouse yet, plan to keep it as a spare.This keyboard is not fancy, but it's cheap, works well, and does the trick. I also have the Logitech K120 and have been using it for years on another Mac with zero issues. The K120 is even cheaper, but it lacks the media buttons on top (volume up, volume down, etc). That's kind of annoying, hence the reason I bumped up to K200 this time.FOR APPLE USERS:Yes, the MK200 will work for you... even the volume buttons. When you plug it in the first time, a message will appear on the screen saying your computer needs some help recognizing it. All you have to do is press the buttons it asks you to press and then you can use it. Quick and easy!If you want the modifier buttons on the MK200 to work exactly as your old keyboard, you will have to swap the positions of the Command and Option keys.To do that:1. Open \"System Preferences\"2. Click \"Keyboard\"3. Click \"Modifier Keys\"4. Change (see attached screenshot):---- Option Key to Command---- Command Key to OptionAfter that, all your quick key shortcuts will work as they did on your Apple keyboard.Hope that helps!UPDATE: Today is August 12, 2020... almost 3 years to the day since I bought this keyboard. I returned to this page so that I could buy another one for a dif computer. Since I was here, I thought I should go ahead and update my review. The original keyboard? I'm *still* using it!\n\n", "\n\n  This combo has a nice design.  The keyboard doesn't mess with tradition, putting all keys where they belong (and the calculator button's a nice touch).  The mouse is a proper size/height and has a good scroll wheel.  Tactile satisfaction is good, and $20 is fair.But I've bought THREE of these MK200 combos over the past year, and each had a major flaw.  On the first combo, the keyboard's spacebar was wonky, only working when pressed in a certain spot.  On the second, the mouse wheel was stiff and imprecise.  So I exchanged it for this third combo that was fine at first, but now three months in, the keyboard is acting up strangely.  When I press Shift + a letter key, one of the two just doesn't register sometimes, causing frequent typos; the number pad's Enter key also cuts in and out on a whim.  If that's not enough, the mouse is starting to register single clicks as double-clicks, making the whole affair a glitchfest concerto.If my math is correct, 3 out of 3 samples konking out calculates to a failure rate of 100%.  Worse, Logitech's customer service reps seem to try to not honor the warranty -- it took about ten back-and-forth e-mails before they caved in, despite my clear-cut proof of purchase and being well within the warranty period.Avoid this product and avoid this company.\n\n", "\n\n  The mouse works fine but the keyboard is a piece of crap. I purchased it on December 29, 2019 and received it during the first week of January. It worked fine for the first couple of months, but come March I started having problems with the keys not working. It started off with the \"n\" key. It just stopped working. I hit the \"n\" and nothing would happen. I blew the dust out of it and vacuumed it trying to fix it. That helped for a few days but the problem returned. Then I started having trouble with the \"r\" key. Then the \"left shift.\" Then the \"space.\" Then the \"h.\" I got so frustrated I put my fist through it destroying it. I have never had problems with any other Logitech products I have purchased (and there have been several), but I'll tell you this--if this is any indication of the present quality of their products, they are a company in trouble. I went back to using my old Microsoft keyboard that this keyboard was supposed to replace. I had been using it for 10+ years--so much in fact that many of the letters have worn off the keys. But mechanically, it still works perfectly. 10 years vs. 2 months. CRAP!I'm not going to say that I won't ever buy another Logitech product again, but I will say that I will certainly consider other brands more closely from now on and I will no longer consider myself a loyal customer of Logitech. Can you tell? I'm very dis-satisfied with this purchase.\n\n", "\n\n  It's a very good keyboard, but I don't recommend it if you're a very fast typist.  I type 150 wpm and it can't keep up with me.  It doesn't register a lot of my keystrokes.  The last Logitech keyboard I had was a wireless--basically the same model--and it (and previous versions of it) were just great, keeping up with me just fine.  I've been using them for years and years.  I wanted to switch to a wired keyboard (since I found out that our wifi was giving me headaches!) and got this one, but it can't keep up with me.  I have to find a better keyboard now.\n\n", "\n\n  This is the second BAD logitech keyboard I've purchased. First one I purchased was wireless and stated acting weird after a few months of use (would type but letters would be delayed/letters would be skipped as if the keyboard was buffering). After getting frustrated too many times to count, I bit the bullet and bought this keyboard, thinking that the wired connection would eliminate any keyboard delays (I type a lot for work, so it is important that they keyboard keeps up with what keys I am typing). I got this keyboard November 2019 and it's already stopped working (it is currently April 2020, aka 5.5 months of use). Certain keys have stopped working completely. I have unplugged and replugged the keyboard, restarted the computer, and even put the keyboard on a different PC - still have the same issue with certain keys not working. I would NOT recommend this as a long term solution. Just pay the money upfront for a better keyboard, rather than paying cheap money for a keyboard you will have to replace every 5 months...\n\n", "\n\n  So I have to agree with a number of other reviewers here, the keyboard is great initially but less than 6 months from purchase several keys stopped working completely, including the left shift key which totally messes up any passwords you're entering and suddenly you're locked out everywhere with no idea why.  The keys still depress and aren't stuck which makes me think it's something in the internal electronics.  I kept it clean and it only had light non-work emails and web browsing so it still looked great in the trash, paint still intact and letters clear.  Sadly, I guess you get what you pay for, it's just a very disappointing deterioration in quality for this brand.\n\n", "\n\n  I ordered this combo on February 11, 2017. It is now March 22, 2018. I regret to report that the letters on the keys are painted in such a manner that they rub off. I no longer have a visible 'A' 'S' 'N' or 'M' key, and the Enter key is half rubbed away. As I'm fine with touch-typing, this isn't really an issue, but it does mean that anyone who isn't (or anyone needing to use my computer for anything) struggle to make sure they're using the correct keys. One would think Logitech could make a keyboard capable of holding up to regular typing, but apparently not this time. The mouse still works fine, but it seems to accumulate stuff along the sides due to the type of plastic it's made out of. I've never had a mouse collect grime/fuzz so quickly, and find myself cleaning this one at least every other week. I've never had to do this with other computer mice, and my wireless usb mouse hasn't given me similar issues (but the plastic is different on the wireless usb mouse, feels more like silicon).\n\n", "\n\n  I had a wired mouse and keyboard from CyberPower that shipped with the custom PC I ordered, but the mouse's squeaky clicks and the keyboard's awful over-sensitivity drove me to eventually seek out replacements.First off... I dunno about those \"features\" to rate. Ergonomic? Not so much. Volume control? Uh... simple up, down, and mute. What's there to rate? And.... \"sheerness\"? W..what?This is advertised as a \"media\" kb/m combo. Which the keyboard fits the description. It has the requisite media buttons (play/pause, skip/reverse, volume up/down/mute, etc) and some browsing controls. Shockingly enough, the mouse has NO features for media or web browsing. I was expecting at least the back and forward keys, maybe the tilt/scroll as well, but that's a negative on those. This is the most basic mouse I have ever used, and frankly, it annoys me that there's only two buttons and a scroll wheel. Not to mention that even though the box claims it's a \"full-size\" mouse, it's way too lightweight and small. I think that's the worst part for me, having mid-to-large hands. Though on the plus side, it's a very smooth mouse which is nice since my displays are 144 Hz. And as I was typing this out, I realized that this keyboard and mouse combo, are in fact, almost the same exact models shipped in the Logitech Wireless Combo (920-008971), minus the wireless part. So I should have expected the same for the mouse, I suppose. Then again, for the price I paid for these, I'm not disappointed, since hey, I have an extra mouse now. But It does mean having to find a mouse to suit my needs (or go back to using my semi-new, but otherwise reliable, wireless Logi M510 that mysteriously stopped working one day). But I will not go back to using that wireless Logitech keyboard, no matter how much I liked its layout and media controls. The intermittent stuttering and unresponsiveness just isn't worth it. I asked for help with that. Their response? \"Use an extension cable.\" I had the dongle two inches from the keyboard, and still the problem persisted. But that's another story. Just be wary of their wireless keyboards!\n\n", "\n\n  Logitech Keyboards are very poor quality now, they must have moved the manufatcturing to a factory that has no quality control/or deliberately builds them to break down really quick, so you haev to order more. My keyboards used to last YEARS!  I have ordered at least five  K120 and K200 Keyboards this past Year and they do not last. I didn't realize the K200 is essentially the same as the K120 but with added smart keys (volume control, power off, etc).  This most recent K200 keyboard lasted a week and then it started to break down (keys starting to make noise and getting really stiff).  There is no ecuse. I have been using a computer for well over 20 years on a regular basis and never had an issue like this with a keyboard. Usually they last me years. This time I ordered a MIcrosoft Keyboard in the same price range and I am very happy with my purchase.  No more Logitech for me.\n\n", "\n\n  Comfortable to use, but after a month or so, the enter key and half the letters stopped working. No clue what went wrong. Was after the returnable date so it's in the box in the closet. Waste of money. Mouse works great though.\n\n", "\n\n  I thought this would be a nice starter for the computer I built until I could save up for a better set: boy, was I wrong. I had to switch out the keyboard with an old wired one after 2 days of using it because the lag on the keyboard was just too much to handle. Half the time it wouldn't even register key presses. Just a disaster. The mouse was fine, or so I thought, until about two weeks in and now it hardly registers movement. It jumps around the screen, just a laggy mess. I've changed the batteries and tried using it on different surfaces but nothing helps. The only way I've been getting temporary relief is by turning it off for a minute or two and turning it back on. Within 5 minutes it's back again. I turn the mouse off when the computer is not in use, as well, so I'm completely stumped. When it started happening, I figured it was because I was playing a video game and the computer was just overwhelmed, but nope, it happens when I'm just browsing the internet, as well. Maybe it's because I'm out of the signal range, but the mouse and keyboard were about a foot away from the usb connector, so if that's the case, it's not worth getting in the first place. Hoping to return this and get a wired keyboard/mouse, because this has turned me off of wireless completely.\n\n", "\n\n  I ordered this keyboard to replace an aging K270. I'm a video game developer and computer consultant so I need a rock solid keyboard, which is why I choose Logitech devices knowing they are solid, even at the budget level. Ive ordered this model before from a different site, and have had no problems, so when the old one started to ware out, I chose the same one. Ive had nothing but problems with the new one.Its weird. This new one wont work with the old ones receiver. The problem is, it doesn't have the orange gear logo on the bottom, showing that its part of the Unifying \"universal wireless system\". When I try to connect to it with my Unifying receiver using the special compatibility software, its detected as M510 mouse and then fails to install. The problem here is I cant use my better Logitech mouse or any other Unifying devices with the K270, or I will need to use 2 receivers, and I don't have any open USB ports, plus there's potential radio interference. I ended up having to ditch my other unifying devices and use the compact mouse it came with.As if that weren't bad enough; it has a horrible lag between key-press and screen input, making it impossible to write with for any amount of time (writing this took some patience). Here's an example; Ill be playing a shooter game and all the sudden the W key stops working and I stop moving forward. I try to hit the escape key, nothing. Then 10 seconds later it escapes. This bug pretty much indicates to me that its a counterfeit or at least an inferior transmitter.Its not the receiver, because Ive had no problems with the M185 mouse. I have full use of the mouse - to open a virtual keyboard and finish typing one click at a time. Its detected by the Unifying software even without the orange Unifying logo and never misses a beat with the new KB and receiver. I would notice any slight stutter in the mouse pointer.  Its compact size is small for my hands and has a loud click, which is bad for in the living room. One other confusing thing: Its labeled MK270 on the box; so shouldn't the mouse be a M270 rather than M185?  No such item exists.Why would they make 2 different versions of the same model? The only indication that its not the same is on the back and in 2mm fine print where its labeled K270 and below M/N: Y-R0042. My old one is a K270 but M/N: Y-R0015. Ive read in the Q&A; someone returned their Y-R0042 and got the Y-R0015 as a replacement.The main point here: unless you want to risk receiving the incompatible and buggy version, don't try this product.\n\n", "\n\n  I have several Logitech products, almost all ( except a Bluetooth headset) are able to work with Logitech's Unifying receiver, a small USB dongle that works with multiple devices. This is NOT one. This item has a separate wireless dongle that ONLY works with the two devices (keyboard and mouse) in the package. I was shopping for a replacement to my previous K800 when this was suggested in the alternatives. This is all the more confusing because there is a MK270 keyboard available with the unifying receiver. Today after several delivery delays I find out that this product is the wifi only version.Note in the image the dongle that came with this product (right) does not have the orange Unifying symbol (left) that my other products' USB adapters all have.The description of this product needs to be updated immediately to unequivocally state it is not a Unifying product. Now that I'm reading the comments, many people have fallen for this same issue. I'll be returning this as soon as I can.\n\n", "\n\n  The build quality of these keyboards is abysmal, from the Latin \"abyssmus,\" meaning \"bottomless pit.\" So this is an appropriate adjective for the quality, as there seems to be no limit to how poorly this hardware performs. I suppose I should have known that a wireless keyboard and mouse combo that costs like fourteen cents wouldn't be found in Trump Tower. But I don't need anything gold plated or huge. It just needs to work for more than four months. I shouldn't have higher monthly computer accessory costs than my Hulu subscription.Won't buy again.\n\n", "\n\n  The wireless response of the mouse is terrible. The USB that goes into the computer HAS to be in a clear path to the wireless keyboard/mouse. If the USB is hidden behind the desktop (I'm talking about 2-3 feet away) the USB receiver stops working correctly, and becomes very \"glitchy\" where the mouse skips inches across the screen and also becomes unresponsive every couple of seconds. If the USB receiver is plugged into the front of the PC in direct sight, then the mouse starts to work ok. I have tested this on multiple laptops, computers that we have at home and the receiver just tends to be terrible. I usually go with Logitech, but not this time. Worst wireless/mouse combo ever purchased.The physical build is ok, but very light. This makes me concerned about the actual durability of the keyboard and mouse. The mouse is a simple one without a back button, but that works just fine for me. I just wished the receiver was better on this model. Who knows, maybe I got a faulty one.\n\n", "\n\n  I'm disappointed because the product description says this comes with a Logitech Unifying Receiver. It does not, and that kind of screwed me because I wanted to pair my trackball with the keyboard, rather than the mouse that comes with it. So while I can still use the trackball, I would have to waste another USB port for the trackball dongle to do so. The whole point behind going with a Logitech device was to avoid having to do this.Anyway, other than that heartache, this is nice full-sized keyboard well-suited to my fat fingers. The keys are a little mushy for my taste, but everything works well enough, So I decided I might as well keep the set rather than return it, and use it for the system in the guest bedroom. When mom and dad are around, they like working with mice.\n\n", "\n\n  Logitech claims that both the mouse, keyboard, and receiver are \"unified\" capable. They are not. It turns out they made multiple versions of the K270 and M675 (the two items included here) but the ones in this package are the very old, non-unified ones.They don't work or recognize when plugged in. Downloading the logitech connection software shows that the USB connector is recognized, but it can't communicate with either the mouse or keyboard. Tested with 2 sets of new batteries and on 2 computers (windows 10 and windows 7).It's clearly the USB dongle that failed, and I considered just ordering a replacement dongle, but that's when it because clear that these are non-unified and can't use a different receiver.It's nice that they are cheap, however they don't perform any function other than making me drive to the UPS store to return them, so I would recommend buying something else.\n\n", "\n\n  If you\u2019re looking for a good wireless keyboard and mouse combo, then the Logitech MK270 is a great option. The keyboard is very responsive and feels great to use, and the mouse is a great addition as well with its amazing DPI. All of these pros combined with the insane battery life of this keyboard and mouse makes for a very high-quality product.While it\u2019s not the best buy for someone who\u2019s looking to extensively game on it, it\u2019s a very versatile mobile mouse and keyboard that more than makes up for its downfalls with an insanely affordable price. If you\u2019re looking for a deal, then you won\u2019t find a better one then the Logitech MK270.Portable and Plug and PlayAt just over a pound, the Logitech MK270 Wireless Combo includes a keyboard and mouse that incorporates the same reliable 2.4 GHz connectivity that eliminates delays, dropouts, and interference with a 30-foot range of motion. What comes in the box is a full-size spill-resistant keyboard, a carry around mouse, a Logitech\u2019s Unifying receiver, batteries for mouse and keyboard, and the user documentation. Both devices are plug \u2018n play (on Mac, Windows, and Chrome OS), so you can simply plug the low-profile receiver into a free USB port and you\u2019ll be wirelessly typing and navigating in no time.Long Battery LifeBoth keyboard and mouse are powered by batteries so you can go for months without the hassle of changing batteries. The Logitech MK270 Wireless Combo connects to your PC using Logitech\u2019s device-networking receiver that allows you to sync your keyboard and up to five additional compatible peripherals at once. The computer instantly recognizes both devices using the Unifying receiver without any software installation and allows you to perform basic typing tasks with reliable wireless connectivity.Great For WorkstationsI use a 17 inch Dell workstation, so my laptop isn\u2019t exactly the type of gadget to keep on the lap. I was having trouble with all the extensive typing required for my job, so I decided to spend some money on a wireless keyboard. I spent some time researching for a value for money combo and after viewing reviews on MK270 Wireless Keyboard, I decided to go in for a quality brand like Logitech because typing is very important in my job and I didn\u2019t want any low-quality product that would eventually give up on me one day.Build Qualityrsz_102603568_02_222430d3-9249-4b2f-8e26-a8baa12b0dc9For a full-size desktop keyboard, the MK270 is pretty decent, and it feels light and sturdy in the hands. The keyboard design is spill proof and has multiple drain holes. The keys themselves are low-profile, and it feels good enough to type reasonably fast. After a few days, I was able to get my preferred words per minute without any trouble because the keys have great travel time between keystrokes and they are very quiet and comfortable. The keyboard contains all the standard keys along with a row of eight designated hotkeys at the top edge of the keyboard frame, which gives you one-touch access to your media applications, calculator, internet functions, and PC shutdown. I usually handle most of my devices very roughly, and with all the extensive typing any keyboard suffers serious abuse in my hands. But so far, the keyboard is doing well and providing a decent response.Logitech MK270\u2019s Mousersz_02603568_01_fe5fa250-ae0e-418b-899e-53985bdbce7dThe mouse also provides a decent experience and is a fantastic spare when you need one most. It\u2019s lightweight and very accurate for a wireless mouse. It has an ON/OFF switch on the back side and the battery compartment, which uses 1 AA battery, also contains a section to keep your receiver in case you\u2019re not using it. The mouse comes with an invisible optic laser that means you can\u2019t see the light, which is a bit uncomfortable but it helps to save some battery. But overall, the mouse feels good in the hands and it does the job well, and that\u2019s about it.If you\u2019re trying to game with the mk270, then this mouse be a little lacking in features. If you\u2019re looking for something to game with, then check out my good cheap gaming mice list.Other Things I Liked About The MK270What I really liked about MK270 is that it comes with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128-Bit Encryption that guarantees all your private keystrokes protection from evil-doers, which I think is a very good feature because the wireless devices can be easily hacked by experienced hackers nowadays. The company also provides an extra software for button customization for both Windows and Chrome OS but unfortunately not for Mac users.The company also provides an extra software for button customization for both Windows and Chrome OS but unfortunately not for Mac users. The software is not required for basic functionality but depending on your personal setup, you might want to visit the website for SetPoint that lets you customize F-keys, hotkeys, and even mouse buttons. For such a low price, the MK270 offers a sturdy wireless keyboard that provides an accurate full-sized typing and a decent mouse experience, without the lag and cheap plastic afflicting most wireless keyboards.Logitech MK270 For GamingI know a lot of my readers are gamers, so I think it\u2019s important to talk about how the Logitech MK270 combo performs when gaming. If I had to give a quick summary, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s good for people who\u2019re going to be playing action games with little to no macros needed. If you\u2019re looking for something with a significant amount extra buttons to key bind your abilities too, then you\u2019ll be very disappointed with the MK270.This combo shines, when you\u2019re looking for a wireless plug and play mouse and keyboard that\u2019s more spacious than your current setup. If you have a desktop, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this for gaming, but If you have a laptop, this could be a great alternative to just using the laptop\u2019s cramped trackpad and keyboard.\n\n", "\n\n  I have kids that dont like to keep thier hands off of things that are not meant for them to play with. (I.E. dads wireless keyboard) I went with a cheaper model so when they inevitably stomp on it, drop it, or spill something on it I wont be too heartbroken. Setup was easy... Plug in the usb dongle, remove the little tags from the surprise included batteries, turn them on and your set!! (On windows 10 at least). Very next day your son deciceds to drive his 1970s model Tonka dumptruck over the keyboard a few times, THEN proceeds to DROP said Tonka on top when he realizes hes been caught. Bet your envisioning keys everywhere, cracked plastic and death to my fancy new wireless keyboard huh?  Nope!! 1 little scratch of the paint on the Win key! Not a stuck or broken key everything works flawlessly. Now dont go buying this thinking its indestructable, Can pretty much assure you it has a weakness, they all do, my kids just havent found it yet! Surprising little tidbit I read on the box and not in the description; the keyboard batteries last up to 36 months and the mouse goes for 18. If I get 6 months outta the (not advertised) included batteries Ill be a happy camper. My old set was lucky to get a month!! Anyhow everything with this set has surpassed my expectations by leaps and bounds. Its light, comfortable, and works fantastically from my couch (12 or so feet from the pc). Im not a power user or super gamer so did not need all the programable buttons and whatnot some of the more costly models include. But I am a cordcutter and my PC is mostly used for tv and movies. The volume keys are awesome for that. And i do like the other function keys. So for the price and features this is a deal and a half to me. Should this one get destroyed by my children I will definately reorder the same.\n\n", "\n\n  This is my second MK270 keyboard-mouse combo; I use them with a laptop computer because I prefer a \"desktop\" keyboard and mouse when I travel.  Why did I buy a second combo? I lost the battery-compartment covers to both keyboard and mouse during my travels, and this is my main reason for subtracting one star.  (A tip: tape the covers in place before you pack these for a trip.)The full-size keyboard (including number-pad) is of the membrane variety with rubber domes under the keycaps; this is the type that is common with all desktop computers sold these days.  The key travel is delightfully longer and more positive-feeling than on my laptop's keyboard, and my first MK270 still works beautifully after three years of daily use -- except the batteries now fall out when I'm traveling. :)  The keycaps are sculpted, much like those on better mechanical keyboards, and the markings (letters, numbers, special characters) show no sign of fading or wearing away.  I think I'll keep this keyboard around as a spare for use on my two desktop computers, or maybe as a keycap-donor.  While it isn't quite as comfortable as a good mechanical keyboard, it's close enough that I can switch back and forth without problems.The mouse uses an optical (but not laser) sensor, which is certainly more than adequate for general use.  It's also slightly smaller than the average mouse, which makes it easier to fit into a pocket in my laptop case -- but not so small that using it becomes a problem for my average-size-male hands.Battery life with both components is pretty good.  Even though I almost never remember to turn them off, the batteries (2 AAA alkalines for the keyboard, 1 AA alkaline for the mouse) generally last far longer than I would have expected.  I usually replace all three every nine to twelve months whether they need it or not.The USB receiver for both components is tiny; I usually leave it plugged in, and the laptop will still fit into a reasonably snug-fitting case or sleeve.  But there is a storage compartment in the mouse -- a nice touch on Logitech's part.The combo does not come with a driver disk, and you should not need one for basic operation under either Windows or Linux.  But software to access the additional feature-keys at the top of the keyboard is available for download from Logitech.This combo would not my first choice for someone who programs or pounds out long documents on a daily basis -- for that I prefer a (wired) mechanical keyboard and trackball connected to a more powerful desktop computer.  Nor do I expect it would be a great choice for a serious gamer.  But for casual or occasional use, it's certainly more than adequate, including a keyboard-feel that is close enough to an electric typewriter to please most users.  And for the price, I consider it a genuine bargain.  Logitech sells a lot of these, and I see them in big-box stores all the time, so others must agree that it's a pretty good deal.If you are a casual computer user, or if you actually prefer the rubber-dome membrane keyswitches, I think you'll like this Logitech keyboard-mouse combo.  in the bargain you'll eliminate a couple of cables running across your desk, and free up one USB port on your computer.\n\n", "\n\n  I thought this would be a nice starter for the computer I built until I could save up for a better set: boy, was I wrong.

I ended up having to ditch my other unifying devices and use the compact mouse it came with.As if that weren't bad enough; it has a horrible lag between key-press and screen input, making it impossible to write with for any amount of time (writing this took some patience). Here's an example; Ill be playing a shooter game and all the sudden the W key stops working and I stop moving forward. I try to hit the escape key, nothing. Then 10 seconds later it escapes. This bug pretty much indicates to me that its a counterfeit or at least an inferior transmitter.Its not the receiver, because Ive had no problems with the M185 mouse. I have full use of the mouse - to open a virtual keyboard and finish typing one click at a time. Its detected by the Unifying software even without the orange Unifying logo and never misses a beat with the new KB and receiver. I would notice any slight stutter in the mouse pointer.  Its compact size is small for my hands and has a loud click, which is bad for in the living room. One other confusing thing: Its labeled MK270 on the box; so shouldn't the mouse be a M270 rather than M185?  No such item exists.Why would they make 2 different versions of the same model? The only indication that its not the same is on the back and in 2mm fine print where its labeled K270 and below M/N: Y-R0042. My old one is a K270 but M/N: Y-R0015. Ive read in the Q&A; someone returned their Y-R0042 and got the Y-R0015 as a replacement.The main point here: unless you want to risk receiving the incompatible and buggy version, don't try this product.\n\n", "\n\n  I have several Logitech products, almost all ( except a Bluetooth headset) are able to work with Logitech's Unifying receiver, a small USB dongle that works with multiple devices. This is NOT one. This item has a separate wireless dongle that ONLY works with the two devices (keyboard and mouse) in the package. I was shopping for a replacement to my previous K800 when this was suggested in the alternatives. This is all the more confusing because there is a MK270 keyboard available with the unifying receiver. Today after several delivery delays I find out that this product is the wifi only version.Note in the image the dongle that came with this product (right) does not have the orange Unifying symbol (left) that my other products' USB adapters all have.The description of this product needs to be updated immediately to unequivocally state it is not a Unifying product.

I suppose I should have known that a wireless keyboard and mouse combo that costs like fourteen cents wouldn't be found in Trump Tower. But I don't need anything gold plated or huge. It just needs to work for more than four months. I shouldn't have higher monthly computer accessory costs than my Hulu subscription.Won't buy again.\n\n", "\n\n  The wireless response of the mouse is terrible. The USB that goes into the computer HAS to be in a clear path to the wireless keyboard/mouse. If the USB is hidden behind the desktop (I'm talking about 2-3 feet away) the USB receiver stops working correctly, and becomes very \"glitchy\" where the mouse skips inches across the screen and also becomes unresponsive every couple of seconds. If the USB receiver is plugged into the front of the PC in direct sight, then the mouse starts to work ok. I have tested this on multiple laptops, computers that we have at home and the receiver just tends to be terrible. I usually go with Logitech, but not this time. Worst wireless/mouse combo ever purchased.The physical build is ok, but very light. This makes me concerned about the actual durability of the keyboard and mouse. The mouse is a simple one without a back button, but that works just fine for me. I just wished the receiver was better on this model. Who knows, maybe I got a faulty one.\n\n", "\n\n  I'm disappointed because the product description says this comes with a Logitech Unifying Receiver. It does not, and that kind of screwed me because I wanted to pair my trackball with the keyboard, rather than the mouse that comes with it. So while I can still use the trackball, I would have to waste another USB port for the trackball dongle to do so. The whole point behind going with a Logitech device was to avoid having to do this.Anyway, other than that heartache, this is nice full-sized keyboard well-suited to my fat fingers. The keys are a little mushy for my taste, but everything works well enough, So I decided I might as well keep the set rather than return it, and use it for the system in the guest bedroom. When mom and dad are around, they like working with mice.\n\n", "\n\n  Logitech claims that both the mouse, keyboard, and receiver are \"unified\" capable. They are not. It turns out they made multiple versions of the K270 and M675 (the two items included here) but the ones in this package are the very old, non-unified ones.They don't work or recognize when plugged in. Downloading the logitech connection software shows that the USB connector is recognized, but it can't communicate with either the mouse or keyboard. Tested with 2 sets of new batteries and on 2 computers (windows 10 and windows 7).It's clearly the USB dongle that failed, and I considered just ordering a replacement dongle, but that's when it because clear that these are non-unified and can't use a different receiver.It's nice that they are cheap, however they don't perform any function other than making me drive to the UPS store to return them, so I would recommend buying something else.\n\n", "\n\n  If you\u2019re looking for a good wireless keyboard and mouse combo, then the Logitech MK270 is a great option. The keyboard is very responsive and feels great to use, and the mouse is a great addition as well with its amazing DPI. All of these pros combined with the insane battery life of this keyboard and mouse makes for a very high-quality product.While it\u2019s not the best buy for someone who\u2019s looking to extensively game on it, it\u2019s a very versatile mobile mouse and keyboard that more than makes up for its downfalls with an insanely affordable price. If you\u2019re looking for a deal, then you won\u2019t find a better one then the Logitech MK270.Portable and Plug and PlayAt just over a pound, the Logitech MK270 Wireless Combo includes a keyboard and mouse that incorporates the same reliable 2.4 GHz connectivity that eliminates delays, dropouts, and interference with a 30-foot range of motion. What comes in the box is a full-size spill-resistant keyboard, a carry around mouse, a Logitech\u2019s Unifying receiver, batteries for mouse and keyboard, and the user documentation. Both devices are plug \u2018n play (on Mac, Windows, and Chrome OS), so you can simply plug the low-profile receiver into a free USB port and you\u2019ll be wirelessly typing and navigating in no time.Long Battery LifeBoth keyboard and mouse are powered by batteries so you can go for months without the hassle of changing batteries. The Logitech MK270 Wireless Combo connects to your PC using Logitech\u2019s device-networking receiver that allows you to sync your keyboard and up to five additional compatible peripherals at once. The computer instantly recognizes both devices using the Unifying receiver without any software installation and allows you to perform basic typing tasks with reliable wireless connectivity.Great For WorkstationsI use a 17 inch Dell workstation, so my laptop isn\u2019t exactly the type of gadget to keep on the lap. I was having trouble with all the extensive typing required for my job, so I decided to spend some money on a wireless keyboard. I spent some time researching for a value for money combo and after viewing reviews on MK270 Wireless Keyboard, I decided to go in for a quality brand like Logitech because typing is very important in my job and I didn\u2019t want any low-quality product that would eventually give up on me one day.Build Qualityrsz_102603568_02_222430d3-9249-4b2f-8e26-a8baa12b0dc9For a full-size desktop keyboard, the MK270 is pretty decent, and it feels light and sturdy in the hands. The keyboard design is spill proof and has multiple drain holes. The keys themselves are low-profile, and it feels good enough to type reasonably fast. After a few days, I was able to get my preferred words per minute without any trouble because the keys have great travel time between keystrokes and they are very quiet and comfortable. The keyboard contains all the standard keys along with a row of eight designated hotkeys at the top edge of the keyboard frame, which gives you one-touch access to your media applications, calculator, internet functions, and PC shutdown. I usually handle most of my devices very roughly, and with all the extensive typing any keyboard suffers serious abuse in my hands. But so far, the keyboard is doing well and providing a decent response.Logitech MK270\u2019s Mousersz_02603568_01_fe5fa250-ae0e-418b-899e-53985bdbce7dThe mouse also provides a decent experience and is a fantastic spare when you need one most. It\u2019s lightweight and very accurate for a wireless mouse. It has an ON/OFF switch on the back side and the battery compartment, which uses 1 AA battery, also contains a section to keep your receiver in case you\u2019re not using it. The mouse comes with an invisible optic laser that means you can\u2019t see the light, which is a bit uncomfortable but it helps to save some battery. But overall, the mouse feels good in the hands and it does the job well, and that\u2019s about it.If you\u2019re trying to game with the mk270, then this mouse be a little lacking in features. If you\u2019re looking for something to game with, then check out my good cheap gaming mice list.Other Things I Liked About The MK270What I really liked about MK270 is that it comes with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128-Bit Encryption that guarantees all your private keystrokes protection from evil-doers, which I think is a very good feature because the wireless devices can be easily hacked by experienced hackers nowadays. The company also provides an extra software for button customization for both Windows and Chrome OS but unfortunately not for Mac users.The company also provides an extra software for button customization for both Windows and Chrome OS but unfortunately not for Mac users. The software is not required for basic functionality but depending on your personal setup, you might want to visit the website for SetPoint that lets you customize F-keys, hotkeys, and even mouse buttons. For such a low price, the MK270 offers a sturdy wireless keyboard that provides an accurate full-sized typing and a decent mouse experience, without the lag and cheap plastic afflicting most wireless keyboards.Logitech MK270 For GamingI know a lot of my readers are gamers, so I think it\u2019s important to talk about how the Logitech MK270 combo performs when gaming. If I had to give a quick summary, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s good for people who\u2019re going to be playing action games with little to no macros needed. If you\u2019re looking for something with a significant amount extra buttons to key bind your abilities too, then you\u2019ll be very disappointed with the MK270.This combo shines, when you\u2019re looking for a wireless plug and play mouse and keyboard that\u2019s more spacious than your current setup. If you have a desktop, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this for gaming, but If you have a laptop, this could be a great alternative to just using the laptop\u2019s cramped trackpad and keyboard.\n\n", "\n\n  I have kids that dont like to keep thier hands off of things that are not meant for them to play with. (I.E. dads wireless keyboard) I went with a cheaper model so when they inevitably stomp on it, drop it, or spill something on it I wont be too heartbroken. Setup was easy... Plug in the usb dongle, remove the little tags from the surprise included batteries, turn them on and your set!! (On windows 10 at least). Very next day your son deciceds to drive his 1970s model Tonka dumptruck over the keyboard a few times, THEN proceeds to DROP said Tonka on top when he realizes hes been caught. Bet your envisioning keys everywhere, cracked plastic and death to my fancy new wireless keyboard huh?  Nope!! 1 little scratch of the paint on the Win key! Not a stuck or broken key everything works flawlessly. Now dont go buying this thinking its indestructable, Can pretty much assure you it has a weakness, they all do, my kids just havent found it yet! Surprising little tidbit I read on the box and not in the description; the keyboard batteries last up to 36 months and the mouse goes for 18. If I get 6 months outta the (not advertised) included batteries Ill be a happy camper. My old set was lucky to get a month!! Anyhow everything with this set has surpassed my expectations by leaps and bounds. Its light, comfortable, and works fantastically from my couch (12 or so feet from the pc). Im not a power user or super gamer so did not need all the programable buttons and whatnot some of the more costly models include. But I am a cordcutter and my PC is mostly used for tv and movies. The volume keys are awesome for that. And i do like the other function keys. So for the price and features this is a deal and a half to me. Should this one get destroyed by my children I will definately reorder the same.\n\n", "\n\n  This is my second MK270 keyboard-mouse combo; I use them with a laptop computer because I prefer a \"desktop\" keyboard and mouse when I travel.  Why did I buy a second combo? I lost the battery-compartment covers to both keyboard and mouse during my travels, and this is my main reason for subtracting one star.  (A tip: tape the covers in place before you pack these for a trip.)The full-size keyboard (including number-pad) is of the membrane variety with rubber domes under the keycaps; this is the type that is common with all desktop computers sold these days.  The key travel is delightfully longer and more positive-feeling than on my laptop's keyboard, and my first MK270 still works beautifully after three years of daily use -- except the batteries now fall out when I'm traveling. :)  The keycaps are sculpted, much like those on better mechanical keyboards, and the markings (letters, numbers, special characters) show no sign of fading or wearing away.  I think I'll keep this keyboard around as a spare for use on my two desktop computers, or maybe as a keycap-donor.  While it isn't quite as comfortable as a good mechanical keyboard, it's close enough that I can switch back and forth without problems.The mouse uses an optical (but not laser) sensor, which is certainly more than adequate for general use.  It's also slightly smaller than the average mouse, which makes it easier to fit into a pocket in my laptop case -- but not so small that using it becomes a problem for my average-size-male hands.Battery life with both components is pretty good.  Even though I almost never remember to turn them off, the batteries (2 AAA alkalines for the keyboard, 1 AA alkaline for the mouse) generally last far longer than I would have expected.  I usually replace all three every nine to twelve months whether they need it or not.The USB receiver for both components is tiny; I usually leave it plugged in, and the laptop will still fit into a reasonably snug-fitting case or sleeve.  But there is a storage compartment in the mouse -- a nice touch on Logitech's part.The combo does not come with a driver disk, and you should not need one for basic operation under either Windows or Linux.  But software to access the additional feature-keys at the top of the keyboard is available for download from Logitech.This combo would not my first choice for someone who programs or pounds out long documents on a daily basis -- for that I prefer a (wired) mechanical keyboard and trackball connected to a more powerful desktop computer.  Nor do I expect it would be a great choice for a serious gamer.  But for casual or occasional use, it's certainly more than adequate, including a keyboard-feel that is close enough to an electric typewriter to please most users.  And for the price, I consider it a genuine bargain.  Logitech sells a lot of these, and I see them in big-box stores all the time, so others must agree that it's a pretty good deal.If you are a casual computer user, or if you actually prefer the rubber-dome membrane keyswitches, I think you'll like this Logitech keyboard-mouse combo.  in the bargain you'll eliminate a couple of cables running across your desk, and free up one USB port on your computer.\n\n", "\n\n  I thought this would be a nice starter for the computer I built until I could save up for a better set: boy, was I wrong. I had to switch out the keyboard with an old wired one after 2 days of using it because the lag on the keyboard was just too much to handle. Half the time it wouldn't even register key presses. Just a disaster. The mouse was fine, or so I thought, until about two weeks in and now it hardly registers movement. It jumps around the screen, just a laggy mess. I've changed the batteries and tried using it on different surfaces but nothing helps. The only way I've been getting temporary relief is by turning it off for a minute or two and turning it back on. Within 5 minutes it's back again. I turn the mouse off when the computer is not in use, as well, so I'm completely stumped. When it started happening, I figured it was because I was playing a video game and the computer was just overwhelmed, but nope, it happens when I'm just browsing the internet, as well. Maybe it's because I'm out of the signal range, but the mouse and keyboard were about a foot away from the usb connector, so if that's the case, it's not worth getting in the first place. Hoping to return this and get a wired keyboard/mouse, because this has turned me off of wireless completely.\n\n", "\n\n  I ordered this keyboard to replace an aging K270. I'm a video game developer and computer consultant so I need a rock solid keyboard, which is why I choose Logitech devices knowing they are solid, even at the budget level. Ive ordered this model before from a different site, and have had no problems, so when the old one started to ware out, I chose the same one. Ive had nothing but problems with the new one.Its weird. This new one wont work with the old ones receiver. The problem is, it doesn't have the orange gear logo on the bottom, showing that its part of the Unifying \"universal wireless system\". When I try to connect to it with my Unifying receiver using the special compatibility software, its detected as M510 mouse and then fails to install.

Should this one get destroyed by my children I will definately reorder the same.\n\n", "\n\n  This is my second MK270 keyboard-mouse combo; I use them with a laptop computer because I prefer a \"desktop\" keyboard and mouse when I travel.  Why did I buy a second combo? I lost the battery-compartment covers to both keyboard and mouse during my travels, and this is my main reason for subtracting one star.  (A tip: tape the covers in place before you pack these for a trip.)The full-size keyboard (including number-pad) is of the membrane variety with rubber domes under the keycaps; this is the type that is common with all desktop computers sold these days.  The key travel is delightfully longer and more positive-feeling than on my laptop's keyboard, and my first MK270 still works beautifully after three years of daily use -- except the batteries now fall out when I'm traveling. :)  The keycaps are sculpted, much like those on better mechanical keyboards, and the markings (letters, numbers, special characters) show no sign of fading or wearing away.  I think I'll keep this keyboard around as a spare for use on my two desktop computers, or maybe as a keycap-donor.  While it isn't quite as comfortable as a good mechanical keyboard, it's close enough that I can switch back and forth without problems.The mouse uses an optical (but not laser) sensor, which is certainly more than adequate for general use.  It's also slightly smaller than the average mouse, which makes it easier to fit into a pocket in my laptop case -- but not so small that using it becomes a problem for my average-size-male hands.Battery life with both components is pretty good.  Even though I almost never remember to turn them off, the batteries (2 AAA alkalines for the keyboard, 1 AA alkaline for the mouse) generally last far longer than I would have expected.  I usually replace all three every nine to twelve months whether they need it or not.The USB receiver for both components is tiny; I usually leave it plugged in, and the laptop will still fit into a reasonably snug-fitting case or sleeve.  But there is a storage compartment in the mouse -- a nice touch on Logitech's part.The combo does not come with a driver disk, and you should not need one for basic operation under either Windows or Linux.  But software to access the additional feature-keys at the top of the keyboard is available for download from Logitech.This combo would not my first choice for someone who programs or pounds out long documents on a daily basis -- for that I prefer a (wired) mechanical keyboard and trackball connected to a more powerful desktop computer.  Nor do I expect it would be a great choice for a serious gamer.  But for casual or occasional use, it's certainly more than adequate, including a keyboard-feel that is close enough to an electric typewriter to please most users.  And for the price, I consider it a genuine bargain.  Logitech sells a lot of these, and I see them in big-box stores all the time, so others must agree that it's a pretty good deal.If you are a casual computer user, or if you actually prefer the rubber-dome membrane keyswitches, I think you'll like this Logitech keyboard-mouse combo.  in the bargain you'll eliminate a couple of cables running across your desk, and free up one USB port on your computer.\n\n", "\n\n  I thought this would be a nice starter for the computer I built until I could save up for a better set: boy, was I wrong. I had to switch out the keyboard with an old wired one after 2 days of using it because the lag on the keyboard was just too much to handle. Half the time it wouldn't even register key presses. Just a disaster. The mouse was fine, or so I thought, until about two weeks in and now it hardly registers movement. It jumps around the screen, just a laggy mess. I've changed the batteries and tried using it on different surfaces but nothing helps. The only way I've been getting temporary relief is by turning it off for a minute or two and turning it back on. Within 5 minutes it's back again. I turn the mouse off when the computer is not in use, as well, so I'm completely stumped. When it started happening, I figured it was because I was playing a video game and the computer was just overwhelmed, but nope, it happens when I'm just browsing the internet, as well. Maybe it's because I'm out of the signal range, but the mouse and keyboard were about a foot away from the usb connector, so if that's the case, it's not worth getting in the first place. Hoping to return this and get a wired keyboard/mouse, because this has turned me off of wireless completely.\n\n", "\n\n  I ordered this keyboard to replace an aging K270. I'm a video game developer and computer consultant so I need a rock solid keyboard, which is why I choose Logitech devices knowing they are solid, even at the budget level. Ive ordered this model before from a different site, and have had no problems, so when the old one started to ware out, I chose the same one. Ive had nothing but problems with the new one.Its weird. This new one wont work with the old ones receiver. The problem is, it doesn't have the orange gear logo on the bottom, showing that its part of the Unifying \"universal wireless system\". When I try to connect to it with my Unifying receiver using the special compatibility software, its detected as M510 mouse and then fails to install. The problem here is I cant use my better Logitech mouse or any other Unifying devices with the K270, or I will need to use 2 receivers, and I don't have any open USB ports, plus there's potential radio interference. I ended up having to ditch my other unifying devices and use the compact mouse it came with.As if that weren't bad enough; it has a horrible lag between key-press and screen input, making it impossible to write with for any amount of time (writing this took some patience). Here's an example; Ill be playing a shooter game and all the sudden the W key stops working and I stop moving forward. I try to hit the escape key, nothing. Then 10 seconds later it escapes. This bug pretty much indicates to me that its a counterfeit or at least an inferior transmitter.Its not the receiver, because Ive had no problems with the M185 mouse. I have full use of the mouse - to open a virtual keyboard and finish typing one click at a time. Its detected by the Unifying software even without the orange Unifying logo and never misses a beat with the new KB and receiver. I would notice any slight stutter in the mouse pointer.  Its compact size is small for my hands and has a loud click, which is bad for in the living room. One other confusing thing: Its labeled MK270 on the box; so shouldn't the mouse be a M270 rather than M185?  No such item exists.Why would they make 2 different versions of the same model? The only indication that its not the same is on the back and in 2mm fine print where its labeled K270 and below M/N: Y-R0042. My old one is a K270 but M/N: Y-R0015. Ive read in the Q&A; someone returned their Y-R0042 and got the Y-R0015 as a replacement.The main point here: unless you want to risk receiving the incompatible and buggy version, don't try this product.\n\n", "\n\n  I have several Logitech products, almost all ( except a Bluetooth headset) are able to work with Logitech's Unifying receiver, a small USB dongle that works with multiple devices. This is NOT one. This item has a separate wireless dongle that ONLY works with the two devices (keyboard and mouse) in the package. I was shopping for a replacement to my previous K800 when this was suggested in the alternatives. This is all the more confusing because there is a MK270 keyboard available with the unifying receiver. Today after several delivery delays I find out that this product is the wifi only version.Note in the image the dongle that came with this product (right) does not have the orange Unifying symbol (left) that my other products' USB adapters all have.The description of this product needs to be updated immediately to unequivocally state it is not a Unifying product. Now that I'm reading the comments, many people have fallen for this same issue. I'll be returning this as soon as I can.\n\n", "\n\n  The build quality of these keyboards is abysmal, from the Latin \"abyssmus,\" meaning \"bottomless pit.\" So this is an appropriate adjective for the quality, as there seems to be no limit to how poorly this hardware performs. I suppose I should have known that a wireless keyboard and mouse combo that costs like fourteen cents wouldn't be found in Trump Tower. But I don't need anything gold plated or huge. It just needs to work for more than four months. I shouldn't have higher monthly computer accessory costs than my Hulu subscription.Won't buy again.\n\n", "\n\n  The wireless response of the mouse is terrible. The USB that goes into the computer HAS to be in a clear path to the wireless keyboard/mouse. If the USB is hidden behind the desktop (I'm talking about 2-3 feet away) the USB receiver stops working correctly, and becomes very \"glitchy\" where the mouse skips inches across the screen and also becomes unresponsive every couple of seconds. If the USB receiver is plugged into the front of the PC in direct sight, then the mouse starts to work ok. I have tested this on multiple laptops, computers that we have at home and the receiver just tends to be terrible. I usually go with Logitech, but not this time. Worst wireless/mouse combo ever purchased.The physical build is ok, but very light. This makes me concerned about the actual durability of the keyboard and mouse. The mouse is a simple one without a back button, but that works just fine for me. I just wished the receiver was better on this model. Who knows, maybe I got a faulty one.\n\n", "\n\n  I'm disappointed because the product description says this comes with a Logitech Unifying Receiver. It does not, and that kind of screwed me because I wanted to pair my trackball with the keyboard, rather than the mouse that comes with it. So while I can still use the trackball, I would have to waste another USB port for the trackball dongle to do so. The whole point behind going with a Logitech device was to avoid having to do this.Anyway, other than that heartache, this is nice full-sized keyboard well-suited to my fat fingers. The keys are a little mushy for my taste, but everything works well enough, So I decided I might as well keep the set rather than return it, and use it for the system in the guest bedroom. When mom and dad are around, they like working with mice.\n\n", "\n\n  Logitech claims that both the mouse, keyboard, and receiver are \"unified\" capable. They are not. It turns out they made multiple versions of the K270 and M675 (the two items included here) but the ones in this package are the very old, non-unified ones.They don't work or recognize when plugged in. Downloading the logitech connection software shows that the USB connector is recognized, but it can't communicate with either the mouse or keyboard. Tested with 2 sets of new batteries and on 2 computers (windows 10 and windows 7).It's clearly the USB dongle that failed, and I considered just ordering a replacement dongle, but that's when it because clear that these are non-unified and can't use a different receiver.It's nice that they are cheap, however they don't perform any function other than making me drive to the UPS store to return them, so I would recommend buying something else.\n\n", "\n\n  If you\u2019re looking for a good wireless keyboard and mouse combo, then the Logitech MK270 is a great option. The keyboard is very responsive and feels great to use, and the mouse is a great addition as well with its amazing DPI. All of these pros combined with the insane battery life of this keyboard and mouse makes for a very high-quality product.While it\u2019s not the best buy for someone who\u2019s looking to extensively game on it, it\u2019s a very versatile mobile mouse and keyboard that more than makes up for its downfalls with an insanely affordable price. If you\u2019re looking for a deal, then you won\u2019t find a better one then the Logitech MK270.Portable and Plug and PlayAt just over a pound, the Logitech MK270 Wireless Combo includes a keyboard and mouse that incorporates the same reliable 2.4 GHz connectivity that eliminates delays, dropouts, and interference with a 30-foot range of motion. What comes in the box is a full-size spill-resistant keyboard, a carry around mouse, a Logitech\u2019s Unifying receiver, batteries for mouse and keyboard, and the user documentation. Both devices are plug \u2018n play (on Mac, Windows, and Chrome OS), so you can simply plug the low-profile receiver into a free USB port and you\u2019ll be wirelessly typing and navigating in no time.Long Battery LifeBoth keyboard and mouse are powered by batteries so you can go for months without the hassle of changing batteries. The Logitech MK270 Wireless Combo connects to your PC using Logitech\u2019s device-networking receiver that allows you to sync your keyboard and up to five additional compatible peripherals at once. The computer instantly recognizes both devices using the Unifying receiver without any software installation and allows you to perform basic typing tasks with reliable wireless connectivity.Great For WorkstationsI use a 17 inch Dell workstation, so my laptop isn\u2019t exactly the type of gadget to keep on the lap. I was having trouble with all the extensive typing required for my job, so I decided to spend some money on a wireless keyboard. I spent some time researching for a value for money combo and after viewing reviews on MK270 Wireless Keyboard, I decided to go in for a quality brand like Logitech because typing is very important in my job and I didn\u2019t want any low-quality product that would eventually give up on me one day.Build Qualityrsz_102603568_02_222430d3-9249-4b2f-8e26-a8baa12b0dc9For a full-size desktop keyboard, the MK270 is pretty decent, and it feels light and sturdy in the hands. The keyboard design is spill proof and has multiple drain holes. The keys themselves are low-profile, and it feels good enough to type reasonably fast. After a few days, I was able to get my preferred words per minute without any trouble because the keys have great travel time between keystrokes and they are very quiet and comfortable. The keyboard contains all the standard keys along with a row of eight designated hotkeys at the top edge of the keyboard frame, which gives you one-touch access to your media applications, calculator, internet functions, and PC shutdown. I usually handle most of my devices very roughly, and with all the extensive typing any keyboard suffers serious abuse in my hands. But so far, the keyboard is doing well and providing a decent response.Logitech MK270\u2019s Mousersz_02603568_01_fe5fa250-ae0e-418b-899e-53985bdbce7dThe mouse also provides a decent experience and is a fantastic spare when you need one most. It\u2019s lightweight and very accurate for a wireless mouse. It has an ON/OFF switch on the back side and the battery compartment, which uses 1 AA battery, also contains a section to keep your receiver in case you\u2019re not using it. The mouse comes with an invisible optic laser that means you can\u2019t see the light, which is a bit uncomfortable but it helps to save some battery. But overall, the mouse feels good in the hands and it does the job well, and that\u2019s about it.If you\u2019re trying to game with the mk270, then this mouse be a little lacking in features. If you\u2019re looking for something to game with, then check out my good cheap gaming mice list.Other Things I Liked About The MK270What I really liked about MK270 is that it comes with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128-Bit Encryption that guarantees all your private keystrokes protection from evil-doers, which I think is a very good feature because the wireless devices can be easily hacked by experienced hackers nowadays. The company also provides an extra software for button customization for both Windows and Chrome OS but unfortunately not for Mac users.The company also provides an extra software for button customization for both Windows and Chrome OS but unfortunately not for Mac users. The software is not required for basic functionality but depending on your personal setup, you might want to visit the website for SetPoint that lets you customize F-keys, hotkeys, and even mouse buttons. For such a low price, the MK270 offers a sturdy wireless keyboard that provides an accurate full-sized typing and a decent mouse experience, without the lag and cheap plastic afflicting most wireless keyboards.Logitech MK270 For GamingI know a lot of my readers are gamers, so I think it\u2019s important to talk about how the Logitech MK270 combo performs when gaming. If I had to give a quick summary, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s good for people who\u2019re going to be playing action games with little to no macros needed. If you\u2019re looking for something with a significant amount extra buttons to key bind your abilities too, then you\u2019ll be very disappointed with the MK270.This combo shines, when you\u2019re looking for a wireless plug and play mouse and keyboard that\u2019s more spacious than your current setup. If you have a desktop, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this for gaming, but If you have a laptop, this could be a great alternative to just using the laptop\u2019s cramped trackpad and keyboard.\n\n", "\n\n  I have kids that dont like to keep thier hands off of things that are not meant for them to play with. (I.E. dads wireless keyboard) I went with a cheaper model so when they inevitably stomp on it, drop it, or spill something on it I wont be too heartbroken. Setup was easy... Plug in the usb dongle, remove the little tags from the surprise included batteries, turn them on and your set!! (On windows 10 at least). Very next day your son deciceds to drive his 1970s model Tonka dumptruck over the keyboard a few times, THEN proceeds to DROP said Tonka on top when he realizes hes been caught. Bet your envisioning keys everywhere, cracked plastic and death to my fancy new wireless keyboard huh?  Nope!! 1 little scratch of the paint on the Win key! Not a stuck or broken key everything works flawlessly. Now dont go buying this thinking its indestructable, Can pretty much assure you it has a weakness, they all do, my kids just havent found it yet! Surprising little tidbit I read on the box and not in the description; the keyboard batteries last up to 36 months and the mouse goes for 18. If I get 6 months outta the (not advertised) included batteries Ill be a happy camper. My old set was lucky to get a month!! Anyhow everything with this set has surpassed my expectations by leaps and bounds. Its light, comfortable, and works fantastically from my couch (12 or so feet from the pc). Im not a power user or super gamer so did not need all the programable buttons and whatnot some of the more costly models include. But I am a cordcutter and my PC is mostly used for tv and movies. The volume keys are awesome for that. And i do like the other function keys. So for the price and features this is a deal and a half to me.

Have owned this keyboard and mouse set for over a year now and LOVE IT. Never had any problems with it. Functions as it should and does it well. Batteries last a long time - as advertised (but depending on actual use). The buttons on the keyboard are soft, precise and fairly quiet. The mouse controls feel very precise as well. The clicks are short and distinct and the scroll wheel feels smooth. There is an LED light on both the keyboard and the mouse that warns you when the batteries need replacement - very handy. The keyboard has an adjustable tilt by moving the rubberized feet. You can also stand it on it's side and let it stand at a 90-degree angle to give you more desktop space. The keyboard also seems to be spill-proof as it is has a few slots on the bottom for the liquid to drain through (see pictures). Range: I sometimes use this set with my TV while the PC (connected via long HDMI cable) they're connected to is in a room about 15 feet away and works without interruptions. Overall, a great set and a good price that lasts and is backed by a good brand! Go Logitech!\n\n", "\n\n  --------------------------------------UPDATE (March 21, 2017)-------------------------------------I have now received the replacement warranty keyboard.  The warranty process was not difficult to initiate, though there were some hoops to jump through and it took a while.  Logitech was pretty good about following up during the process as well.  Kudos!  The replacement keyboard appears to be of similar manufacturing quality as the previous one (see items 1, 2, & 6 from the original review below).  It is clear to me that the original manufacturer of the this product for purchases made in 2014-2015 is likely not being used anymore, but I'll give this replacement keyboard a chance.  Perhaps the last one was just a \"dud.\"In summary, I recommend this keyboard based on the design (look and feel is great), but caution any buyers that you may run into issues within several months.  Again, I'll update this review in a few months to let the Amazon community know how this replacement keyboard is performing.  If this keyboard ends up being fine after 6 months, I would say that my experience may have been an anomaly.  However, if the same thing happens, then there may be a systematic problem.  Stay tuned!--------------------------------------UPDATE (March 9, 2017)-------------------------------------As of March, 2017, the keys on the keyboard are now failing and require more pressure to push, resulting in many missed characters and more typos.  I'm incredibly disappointed... Amazon has NOT responded to my original inquiry, but I contacted them today by phone and they were more helpful.  They suggested that I contact the manufacturer and file a claim against the 3 year warranty.Also, I now think that a more likely scenario than the product being counterfeit is that Logitech changed manufacturers or reduced costs in some way.  Unfortunately, their cost reduction has resulted in a lousy product and tarnishes the Logitech brand name. I no longer blindly trust the Logitech brand with regard to quality.  I will update this review once I know where Logitech stands in regard to customer service and honoring their warranty.One last thing: The item in the Amazon photos is not identical to the product I received.-------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW (November, 2016)------------------------I believe the product that was shipped to me was COUNTERFEIT and not actual Logitech. I have purchased this same keyboard made by Logitech for multiple computers and this one is different for several reasons, albeit it looks pretty close:1. Keys are made of coarse plastic (not smooth)2. Logo looks wrong3. The mouse is already falling apart after a month4. Keys don't press smoothly5. Range is much poorer than previous ones I've owned6. The paint on the keys is clearly poor qualityI have an open inquiry with Amazon regarding this item/seller. It is possible that Logitech decided to save money on costs and reduced quality, but the item doesn't feel right. Will update review accordingly.Thanks!\n\n", "\n\n  I bought my first MK520 set a couple years ago. The mouse and keyboard both worked great until recently I noticed my left mouse button wasn't working properly. It would register single clicks as double clicks and wouldn't always register when I was performing a long press. Because I was still within the warranty period I contacted Logitech and requested a replacement. After providing proof of purchase from Amazon, Logitech sent me a brand new MK520 set. The warranty process took about a week -- all by email -- and was easy and painless. I was very pleased to see Logitech stand by its product and send me a replacement mouse and keyboard even though my keyboard was still working perfectly.Now that I have the new set, I am enjoying this product even more. The latest version of the keyboard has different keys than the set I had previously. The keys feel a little more \"gritty\" which allows my fingers to grasp the keys better. Not much changed about the mouse, but it was already adequate. Wireless signal strength is still great and never was an issue. Battery life is much better than the cheaper Logitech set I owned several years ago before my first MK520 set.Overall I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it for anyone looking for a decent keyboard and mouse at a reasonable price. Also and most importantly: if you run into any problems or defects with your keyboard or mouse and you're within the warranty period, contact Logitech! They will work with you to rectify the issue and will send you a free replacement if need be.(Note: one star was deducted from rating because the first mouse failed. While Logitech did a great job resolving the issue, the fact is that it still occurred.)\n\n", "\n\n  I've been using this set daily for about 6 months now.  I loved it at first... but have begun to have major response issues with both the keyboard AND the mouse.  Since I work in graphic design and often need major precision... this is a big problem.  It will just freeze up & then be ok, and freeze up again.  As other reviews have said, the keyboard occasionally has lag issues and the shift & ctrl keys struggle from time to time.  The USB is not too far away, and I have also tried fresh batteries.  :(  I guess this set is not as good as I hoped.Revised my original review from 3 stars to 1 after a few more months of use.  The keys got slower to respond, prone to freeze-up and super frustrating.  I'm really over it.  In order for me to continue working, I had to switch back to a plug in set.\n\n", "\n\n  I like the full size keyboard.  I have it only 4 stars for the following reasons:  1.  The keyboard requires AAA batteries.  There would be plenty of room for AA batteries and I would expect that battery changes would be far less frequent.  The mouse takes one AA battery.  Thus you need two sizes of batteries to keep this puppy running.2.  The keyboard has an ON/OFF switch, which is fine.  But what dweeb thought it ought to be located on the underside of the keyboard, instead of the top?  Perhaps the dweebs at Logitech could explain why it's better to have the switch on the bottom and out of sight with black raised letters on a black background to indicate the switch position.  The mouse's switch is also on the bottom, which I can sorta understand, but it has contrasting labeling of the switch position. and 3.  i HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN THAT THE KEYBOARD, AND SOMETIMES THE MOUSE, SEEMED TO BE VERY SLOW TO RESPOND.  TURNING THE KEYBOARD IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION SEEMED TO HELP.  iT WAS SO BAD i HAD TO GO BACK TO WIRED KEYBOARD AND MOUSE.  THOSE WIRES DROVE ME QUICKLY NUTS.  I REALIZED THAT THERE WAS SOME INTERFERENCE ISSUE.  AS I WAS LOOKING AT USB HUBS, TO PUT SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN THE COMPUTER AND THE DONGLE, I NOTICED SOMEONE MENTIONING THAT THERE WAS INTERFERENCE PROBLEMS WITH SOME DEVICES USING THE USB 3.0 CONNECTIONS.  I SWITCHED THE MOUSE/KEYBOARD DONGLE OVER TO A USB 2.0 PORT AND THE THING WORKS FINE.  MAYBE LOGITECH OUGHT TO MENTION THIS PROMINENTLY.\n\n", "\n\n  Knowing that we all have our preferences for keyboard touch and feel, I have to say that I love this one which arrived an hour ago.  Keys are slightly concave.  Noise is quite moderate, just enough to know that I have hit the key.  Not only does the Caps Lock key have an on/off light in the key itselt, but it is intuitive.  If I start to type my name using lower case, it automatically capitalizes the J.  All of the keys work.  I like the  comfortable wide hand rest below the keys. The mouse glides very smoothly, feels comfortable and works perfectly as far as I am concerned.  My computer is in a cabinet with a wooden door about 30 inches away but no problem \"hearing\" the keyboard/mouse.  I tried moving the keyboard 8 feet away, still no problem.  Setup took less than 5 minutes.  With pre-installed batteries it was just a matter of plugging the tiny receiver into a USB port on the computer, turning the keyboard and mouse on, and away we go.  I should mention that I put out a question on whether there was a caps-lock light and got both yeses and nos, but the keyboard I received on 9/13/17 has the light.  And I get zero delay, hit the key and the character appears instantly.\n\n", "\n\n  Well, the reviews were mostly positive but my experience has been the opposite of many. The layout of the keys feels off and there is not enough edge to the keys for typing to feel natural and often find myself looking at the keys to adjust my hand placement. That likely speaks more to my typing ability than to the keyboard itself, but it is still annoying. More annoying is the fact that the area where your palms rest will scroll my entire screen down if I happen to put too much pressure on it. My final annoyance is that today the keyboard rattles with every single keystroke like something internally is loose. I have had the keyboard 2 months and will likely go back to my old keyboard within hours. This is second rate junk made as cheaply as possible and any other features are meaningless when the basic functionality is so crummy.\n\n", "\n\n  I've been using this keyboard for about 3 years every single day in a computer heavy job. I've bought several others for our company based on how much I like it. I've worn flat spots on keys, worn paint off the mouse. Just a well built, solid setup!Keyboard has a great layout- Not a lot of frills, but simple and accessible extras like volume controls and a calculator button above the 10 key (I do a lot of math for my work, making this super handy). Keyboard is spacious enough so there's space between things like backspace and insert.

Having a problem with the mouse.  It seems to be receiving a single to double click or click and drag when I am just single clicking the button.  Not a dirt problem, not a battery problem, and I am pretty sure it is not a driver or setting problem.  I have tried several times of setting the double click speed both faster and slower.  It is becoming difficult to select a block of text with it.  So I am replacing it after a year.  Just goes to show you that in a production run of products, sometimes you get a good one, sometimes you get a bad one.1-19-21 another add on to this review. The mouse is crapping out again. Obviously the newer mice are made more cheaply and that left click button does not hold up. Getting a bit tired of it.

This combo from Logitech works flawlessly. The mouse sensitivity was great right out of the box (I realize it's adjustable in Windows as well), and the keyboard has a quality look and feel, with a very micro-pebbly, matte texture and great key shape. I think they refer to the key shapes as 'chiclet' which is appropriate, as they have rounded edges that prevent inadvertent striking of the key next to the one you are trying to strike.

Keyboard also has some interesting shortcut keys on the function row, I haven't explored them all but I did notice (and appreciate) a calculator key that launches the Windows calculator when pressed.

Have owned this keyboard and mouse set for over a year now and LOVE IT. Never had any problems with it. Functions as it should and does it well. Batteries last a long time - as advertised (but depending on actual use). The buttons on the keyboard are soft, precise and fairly quiet. The mouse controls feel very precise as well. The clicks are short and distinct and the scroll wheel feels smooth. There is an LED light on both the keyboard and the mouse that warns you when the batteries need replacement - very handy. The keyboard has an adjustable tilt by moving the rubberized feet. You can also stand it on it's side and let it stand at a 90-degree angle to give you more desktop space. The keyboard also seems to be spill-proof as it is has a few slots on the bottom for the liquid to drain through (see pictures). Range: I sometimes use this set with my TV while the PC (connected via long HDMI cable) they're connected to is in a room about 15 feet away and works without interruptions.

Go Logitech!\n\n", "\n\n  --------------------------------------UPDATE (March 21, 2017)-------------------------------------I have now received the replacement warranty keyboard.  The warranty process was not difficult to initiate, though there were some hoops to jump through and it took a while.  Logitech was pretty good about following up during the process as well.  Kudos!  The replacement keyboard appears to be of similar manufacturing quality as the previous one (see items 1, 2, & 6 from the original review below).  It is clear to me that the original manufacturer of the this product for purchases made in 2014-2015 is likely not being used anymore, but I'll give this replacement keyboard a chance.  Perhaps the last one was just a \"dud.\"In summary, I recommend this keyboard based on the design (look and feel is great), but caution any buyers that you may run into issues within several months.  Again, I'll update this review in a few months to let the Amazon community know how this replacement keyboard is performing.  If this keyboard ends up being fine after 6 months, I would say that my experience may have been an anomaly.  However, if the same thing happens, then there may be a systematic problem.  Stay tuned!--------------------------------------UPDATE (March 9, 2017)-------------------------------------As of March, 2017, the keys on the keyboard are now failing and require more pressure to push, resulting in many missed characters and more typos.  I'm incredibly disappointed... Amazon has NOT responded to my original inquiry, but I contacted them today by phone and they were more helpful.  They suggested that I contact the manufacturer and file a claim against the 3 year warranty.Also, I now think that a more likely scenario than the product being counterfeit is that Logitech changed manufacturers or reduced costs in some way.  Unfortunately, their cost reduction has resulted in a lousy product and tarnishes the Logitech brand name. I no longer blindly trust the Logitech brand with regard to quality.  I will update this review once I know where Logitech stands in regard to customer service and honoring their warranty.One last thing: The item in the Amazon photos is not identical to the product I received.-------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW (November, 2016)------------------------I believe the product that was shipped to me was COUNTERFEIT and not actual Logitech. I have purchased this same keyboard made by Logitech for multiple computers and this one is different for several reasons, albeit it looks pretty close:1. Keys are made of coarse plastic (not smooth)2. Logo looks wrong3. The mouse is already falling apart after a month4. Keys don't press smoothly5. Range is much poorer than previous ones I've owned6. The paint on the keys is clearly poor qualityI have an open inquiry with Amazon regarding this item/seller. It is possible that Logitech decided to save money on costs and reduced quality, but the item doesn't feel right. Will update review accordingly.Thanks!\n\n", "\n\n  I bought my first MK520 set a couple years ago. The mouse and keyboard both worked great until recently I noticed my left mouse button wasn't working properly. It would register single clicks as double clicks and wouldn't always register when I was performing a long press. Because I was still within the warranty period I contacted Logitech and requested a replacement. After providing proof of purchase from Amazon, Logitech sent me a brand new MK520 set. The warranty process took about a week -- all by email -- and was easy and painless. I was very pleased to see Logitech stand by its product and send me a replacement mouse and keyboard even though my keyboard was still working perfectly.Now that I have the new set, I am enjoying this product even more. The latest version of the keyboard has different keys than the set I had previously. The keys feel a little more \"gritty\" which allows my fingers to grasp the keys better. Not much changed about the mouse, but it was already adequate. Wireless signal strength is still great and never was an issue. Battery life is much better than the cheaper Logitech set I owned several years ago before my first MK520 set.Overall I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it for anyone looking for a decent keyboard and mouse at a reasonable price. Also and most importantly: if you run into any problems or defects with your keyboard or mouse and you're within the warranty period, contact Logitech! They will work with you to rectify the issue and will send you a free replacement if need be.(Note: one star was deducted from rating because the first mouse failed. While Logitech did a great job resolving the issue, the fact is that it still occurred.)\n\n", "\n\n  I've been using this set daily for about 6 months now.  I loved it at first... but have begun to have major response issues with both the keyboard AND the mouse.  Since I work in graphic design and often need major precision... this is a big problem.  It will just freeze up & then be ok, and freeze up again.  As other reviews have said, the keyboard occasionally has lag issues and the shift & ctrl keys struggle from time to time.  The USB is not too far away, and I have also tried fresh batteries.  :(  I guess this set is not as good as I hoped.Revised my original review from 3 stars to 1 after a few more months of use.  The keys got slower to respond, prone to freeze-up and super frustrating.  I'm really over it.  In order for me to continue working, I had to switch back to a plug in set.\n\n", "\n\n  I like the full size keyboard.  I have it only 4 stars for the following reasons:  1.  The keyboard requires AAA batteries.  There would be plenty of room for AA batteries and I would expect that battery changes would be far less frequent.  The mouse takes one AA battery.  Thus you need two sizes of batteries to keep this puppy running.2.  The keyboard has an ON/OFF switch, which is fine.  But what dweeb thought it ought to be located on the underside of the keyboard, instead of the top?  Perhaps the dweebs at Logitech could explain why it's better to have the switch on the bottom and out of sight with black raised letters on a black background to indicate the switch position.  The mouse's switch is also on the bottom, which I can sorta understand, but it has contrasting labeling of the switch position. and 3.  i HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN THAT THE KEYBOARD, AND SOMETIMES THE MOUSE, SEEMED TO BE VERY SLOW TO RESPOND.  TURNING THE KEYBOARD IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION SEEMED TO HELP.  iT WAS SO BAD i HAD TO GO BACK TO WIRED KEYBOARD AND MOUSE.  THOSE WIRES DROVE ME QUICKLY NUTS.  I REALIZED THAT THERE WAS SOME INTERFERENCE ISSUE.  AS I WAS LOOKING AT USB HUBS, TO PUT SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN THE COMPUTER AND THE DONGLE, I NOTICED SOMEONE MENTIONING THAT THERE WAS INTERFERENCE PROBLEMS WITH SOME DEVICES USING THE USB 3.0 CONNECTIONS.  I SWITCHED THE MOUSE/KEYBOARD DONGLE OVER TO A USB 2.0 PORT AND THE THING WORKS FINE.  MAYBE LOGITECH OUGHT TO MENTION THIS PROMINENTLY.\n\n", "\n\n  Knowing that we all have our preferences for keyboard touch and feel, I have to say that I love this one which arrived an hour ago.  Keys are slightly concave.  Noise is quite moderate, just enough to know that I have hit the key.  Not only does the Caps Lock key have an on/off light in the key itselt, but it is intuitive.  If I start to type my name using lower case, it automatically capitalizes the J.  All of the keys work.  I like the  comfortable wide hand rest below the keys. The mouse glides very smoothly, feels comfortable and works perfectly as far as I am concerned.  My computer is in a cabinet with a wooden door about 30 inches away but no problem \"hearing\" the keyboard/mouse.  I tried moving the keyboard 8 feet away, still no problem.  Setup took less than 5 minutes.  With pre-installed batteries it was just a matter of plugging the tiny receiver into a USB port on the computer, turning the keyboard and mouse on, and away we go.  I should mention that I put out a question on whether there was a caps-lock light and got both yeses and nos, but the keyboard I received on 9/13/17 has the light.  And I get zero delay, hit the key and the character appears instantly.\n\n", "\n\n  Well, the reviews were mostly positive but my experience has been the opposite of many. The layout of the keys feels off and there is not enough edge to the keys for typing to feel natural and often find myself looking at the keys to adjust my hand placement. That likely speaks more to my typing ability than to the keyboard itself, but it is still annoying. More annoying is the fact that the area where your palms rest will scroll my entire screen down if I happen to put too much pressure on it. My final annoyance is that today the keyboard rattles with every single keystroke like something internally is loose. I have had the keyboard 2 months and will likely go back to my old keyboard within hours. This is second rate junk made as cheaply as possible and any other features are meaningless when the basic functionality is so crummy.\n\n", "\n\n  I've been using this keyboard for about 3 years every single day in a computer heavy job. I've bought several others for our company based on how much I like it. I've worn flat spots on keys, worn paint off the mouse. Just a well built, solid setup!Keyboard has a great layout- Not a lot of frills, but simple and accessible extras like volume controls and a calculator button above the 10 key (I do a lot of math for my work, making this super handy).

I type pretty fast, probably 60 words per minute when really going, and this keyboard keeps up no problem.There is one USB receiver for both the keyboard and mouse, which is nice as it doesn't take up any more USB ports than needed. Mine is plugged into a desktop about two feet from the keyboard and three feet from the mouse - no transmission issues whatsoever. Keyboard also has some interesting shortcut keys on the function row, I haven't explored them all but I did notice (and appreciate) a calculator key that launches the Windows calculator when pressed. I didn't know I had a Windows calculator!All in all very pleased with this purchase - reasonable price for well above average quality.\n\n", "\n\n  I have owned a few different Logitech accessories over the years and loved them all. Have owned this keyboard and mouse set for over a year now and LOVE IT. Never had any problems with it. Functions as it should and does it well. Batteries last a long time - as advertised (but depending on actual use). The buttons on the keyboard are soft, precise and fairly quiet. The mouse controls feel very precise as well. The clicks are short and distinct and the scroll wheel feels smooth. There is an LED light on both the keyboard and the mouse that warns you when the batteries need replacement - very handy. The keyboard has an adjustable tilt by moving the rubberized feet. You can also stand it on it's side and let it stand at a 90-degree angle to give you more desktop space. The keyboard also seems to be spill-proof as it is has a few slots on the bottom for the liquid to drain through (see pictures). Range: I sometimes use this set with my TV while the PC (connected via long HDMI cable) they're connected to is in a room about 15 feet away and works without interruptions. Overall, a great set and a good price that lasts and is backed by a good brand! Go Logitech!\n\n", "\n\n  --------------------------------------UPDATE (March 21, 2017)-------------------------------------I have now received the replacement warranty keyboard.  The warranty process was not difficult to initiate, though there were some hoops to jump through and it took a while.  Logitech was pretty good about following up during the process as well.  Kudos!  The replacement keyboard appears to be of similar manufacturing quality as the previous one (see items 1, 2, & 6 from the original review below).  It is clear to me that the original manufacturer of the this product for purchases made in 2014-2015 is likely not being used anymore, but I'll give this replacement keyboard a chance.  Perhaps the last one was just a \"dud.\"In summary, I recommend this keyboard based on the design (look and feel is great), but caution any buyers that you may run into issues within several months.  Again, I'll update this review in a few months to let the Amazon community know how this replacement keyboard is performing.  If this keyboard ends up being fine after 6 months, I would say that my experience may have been an anomaly.  However, if the same thing happens, then there may be a systematic problem.  Stay tuned!--------------------------------------UPDATE (March 9, 2017)-------------------------------------As of March, 2017, the keys on the keyboard are now failing and require more pressure to push, resulting in many missed characters and more typos.  I'm incredibly disappointed... Amazon has NOT responded to my original inquiry, but I contacted them today by phone and they were more helpful.  They suggested that I contact the manufacturer and file a claim against the 3 year warranty.Also, I now think that a more likely scenario than the product being counterfeit is that Logitech changed manufacturers or reduced costs in some way.  Unfortunately, their cost reduction has resulted in a lousy product and tarnishes the Logitech brand name. I no longer blindly trust the Logitech brand with regard to quality.  I will update this review once I know where Logitech stands in regard to customer service and honoring their warranty.One last thing: The item in the Amazon photos is not identical to the product I received.-------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW (November, 2016)------------------------I believe the product that was shipped to me was COUNTERFEIT and not actual Logitech. I have purchased this same keyboard made by Logitech for multiple computers and this one is different for several reasons, albeit it looks pretty close:1. Keys are made of coarse plastic (not smooth)2. Logo looks wrong3. The mouse is already falling apart after a month4. Keys don't press smoothly5. Range is much poorer than previous ones I've owned6. The paint on the keys is clearly poor qualityI have an open inquiry with Amazon regarding this item/seller. It is possible that Logitech decided to save money on costs and reduced quality, but the item doesn't feel right. Will update review accordingly.Thanks!\n\n", "\n\n  I bought my first MK520 set a couple years ago. The mouse and keyboard both worked great until recently I noticed my left mouse button wasn't working properly. It would register single clicks as double clicks and wouldn't always register when I was performing a long press. Because I was still within the warranty period I contacted Logitech and requested a replacement. After providing proof of purchase from Amazon, Logitech sent me a brand new MK520 set. The warranty process took about a week -- all by email -- and was easy and painless. I was very pleased to see Logitech stand by its product and send me a replacement mouse and keyboard even though my keyboard was still working perfectly.Now that I have the new set, I am enjoying this product even more. The latest version of the keyboard has different keys than the set I had previously. The keys feel a little more \"gritty\" which allows my fingers to grasp the keys better. Not much changed about the mouse, but it was already adequate. Wireless signal strength is still great and never was an issue. Battery life is much better than the cheaper Logitech set I owned several years ago before my first MK520 set.Overall I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it for anyone looking for a decent keyboard and mouse at a reasonable price. Also and most importantly: if you run into any problems or defects with your keyboard or mouse and you're within the warranty period, contact Logitech! They will work with you to rectify the issue and will send you a free replacement if need be.(Note: one star was deducted from rating because the first mouse failed. While Logitech did a great job resolving the issue, the fact is that it still occurred.)\n\n", "\n\n  I've been using this set daily for about 6 months now.  I loved it at first... but have begun to have major response issues with both the keyboard AND the mouse.  Since I work in graphic design and often need major precision... this is a big problem.  It will just freeze up & then be ok, and freeze up again.  As other reviews have said, the keyboard occasionally has lag issues and the shift & ctrl keys struggle from time to time.  The USB is not too far away, and I have also tried fresh batteries.  :(  I guess this set is not as good as I hoped.Revised my original review from 3 stars to 1 after a few more months of use.  The keys got slower to respond, prone to freeze-up and super frustrating.  I'm really over it.  In order for me to continue working, I had to switch back to a plug in set.\n\n", "\n\n  I like the full size keyboard.  I have it only 4 stars for the following reasons:  1.  The keyboard requires AAA batteries.  There would be plenty of room for AA batteries and I would expect that battery changes would be far less frequent.  The mouse takes one AA battery.  Thus you need two sizes of batteries to keep this puppy running.2.  The keyboard has an ON/OFF switch, which is fine.  But what dweeb thought it ought to be located on the underside of the keyboard, instead of the top?  Perhaps the dweebs at Logitech could explain why it's better to have the switch on the bottom and out of sight with black raised letters on a black background to indicate the switch position.  The mouse's switch is also on the bottom, which I can sorta understand, but it has contrasting labeling of the switch position. and 3.  i HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN THAT THE KEYBOARD, AND SOMETIMES THE MOUSE, SEEMED TO BE VERY SLOW TO RESPOND.  TURNING THE KEYBOARD IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION SEEMED TO HELP.  iT WAS SO BAD i HAD TO GO BACK TO WIRED KEYBOARD AND MOUSE.  THOSE WIRES DROVE ME QUICKLY NUTS.  I REALIZED THAT THERE WAS SOME INTERFERENCE ISSUE.  AS I WAS LOOKING AT USB HUBS, TO PUT SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN THE COMPUTER AND THE DONGLE, I NOTICED SOMEONE MENTIONING THAT THERE WAS INTERFERENCE PROBLEMS WITH SOME DEVICES USING THE USB 3.0 CONNECTIONS.  I SWITCHED THE MOUSE/KEYBOARD DONGLE OVER TO A USB 2.0 PORT AND THE THING WORKS FINE.  MAYBE LOGITECH OUGHT TO MENTION THIS PROMINENTLY.\n\n", "\n\n  Knowing that we all have our preferences for keyboard touch and feel, I have to say that I love this one which arrived an hour ago.  Keys are slightly concave.  Noise is quite moderate, just enough to know that I have hit the key.  Not only does the Caps Lock key have an on/off light in the key itselt, but it is intuitive.  If I start to type my name using lower case, it automatically capitalizes the J.  All of the keys work.  I like the  comfortable wide hand rest below the keys. The mouse glides very smoothly, feels comfortable and works perfectly as far as I am concerned.  My computer is in a cabinet with a wooden door about 30 inches away but no problem \"hearing\" the keyboard/mouse.  I tried moving the keyboard 8 feet away, still no problem.  Setup took less than 5 minutes.  With pre-installed batteries it was just a matter of plugging the tiny receiver into a USB port on the computer, turning the keyboard and mouse on, and away we go.  I should mention that I put out a question on whether there was a caps-lock light and got both yeses and nos, but the keyboard I received on 9/13/17 has the light.  And I get zero delay, hit the key and the character appears instantly.\n\n", "\n\n  Well, the reviews were mostly positive but my experience has been the opposite of many. The layout of the keys feels off and there is not enough edge to the keys for typing to feel natural and often find myself looking at the keys to adjust my hand placement. That likely speaks more to my typing ability than to the keyboard itself, but it is still annoying. More annoying is the fact that the area where your palms rest will scroll my entire screen down if I happen to put too much pressure on it. My final annoyance is that today the keyboard rattles with every single keystroke like something internally is loose. I have had the keyboard 2 months and will likely go back to my old keyboard within hours. This is second rate junk made as cheaply as possible and any other features are meaningless when the basic functionality is so crummy.\n\n", "\n\n  I've been using this keyboard for about 3 years every single day in a computer heavy job. I've bought several others for our company based on how much I like it. I've worn flat spots on keys, worn paint off the mouse. Just a well built, solid setup!Keyboard has a great layout- Not a lot of frills, but simple and accessible extras like volume controls and a calculator button above the 10 key (I do a lot of math for my work, making this super handy). Keyboard is spacious enough so there's space between things like backspace and insert. I once had a keyboard that was a lot tighter, and ended up removing the insert key because I kept hitting it while typing fast. You don't appreciate that extra room till you don't have it.Mouse is comfortable, buttons and wheel click just right. Rubbery sides are still perfect after three years, balancing grippiness with not picking up stuff.I think I've replaced batteries about three times in three years (at most).Highly recommended setup!\n\n", "\n\n  I have had this mouse and keyboard set up for 7 years on a Dell computer.  I have just upgraded computers and wanted the same mouse and keyboard to keep my feel on the keyboard the same.  And I will refer to the Dell once and a while as my backup computer.  So the new keyboard and mouse are working great now.  Yesterday not so great as I figured one thing out.  I had put the receiver in a USB port directly beside the USB connection for my laser printer.  When I was printing, the mouse would stutter, freeze, or disappear.  I have a new Duracell battery in it, not the cheap supplied battery.  But I was noticing a pattern, and yes, when I typed, sometimes what I typed took several seconds to appear.  I now re-located the receiver to another USB port not near the laser printer cable.  And mouse speed and typing speed are back to their exceptional fastness.  So for anyone encountering the drag problem, get the receiver away from printer cables, or possibly other USB devices.  I would think external hard drives and DVD players would not be as big of an issue as a laser printer.  But they could be.And for those who actually complain about the noise of the keyboard, yes it makes noise.  If no radio or TV are on in the room, you will hear every keystroke.  But it is not a loud annoying sound, it is just the flow of your work.  The keyboard feels great to use.  You get to snap the keys a little and they respond well.  A fair trade off for a little bit of noise.  And if the noise is a problem, turn up the music a little.  The fan in my laser printer next to me is far more annoying than the keyboard click.  Better than having to shove your fingers on the keys to get them to respond.4-10-19 Add on and change to review.  I am purchasing another one because very possible this set is a bit defective.  Having a problem with the mouse.  It seems to be receiving a single to double click or click and drag when I am just single clicking the button.  Not a dirt problem, not a battery problem, and I am pretty sure it is not a driver or setting problem.  I have tried several times of setting the double click speed both faster and slower.  It is becoming difficult to select a block of text with it.  So I am replacing it after a year.  Just goes to show you that in a production run of products, sometimes you get a good one, sometimes you get a bad one.1-19-21 another add on to this review. The mouse is crapping out again. Obviously the newer mice are made more cheaply and that left click button does not hold up. Getting a bit tired of it. Really like the keyboard, allows me to type fast and accurate (most of the time). But these mice. Come Logitech, put some quality back into it.\n\n", "\n\n  Bought this to replace an Anker keyboard/mouse set, also wireless, that had serious lag issues in time it took for keystrokes to register on screen. This combo from Logitech works flawlessly.

Why? Lets finally go FULL USB C not this half butt effort. I want to see a full butt USB C effort.\n\n", "\n\n  The scroll wheel is awesome. The fit and finish is awesome though it should have a model slippery rubber coating when I can get around that problem. The buttons are decent enough. The scroll wheel is awesome. But......Damn it damn it damn it. How many times is it going to take for you to get the damned forward and back buttons right!Version one sucked. Version 2 sucked. Version 3 walad admittedly slightly improved, STILL STUCK!They are too small , too stiff, and meld in to everything around them.They need to be made much larger and they need to be place much lower.Oh well. Maybe version 4 will get them right...TWO stars off for little or no useability testing with REAL customers instead of devs and managers.Damn it.\n\n", "\n\n  I have the former MX Master 2S and upgraded to the 3. All seems fine except the scrolling with the scroll wheel. After about 3 turns of the wheel the web pages don't scroll consistently (tried multiple browsers) as if the wheel turning is not being detected internally properly. I tried the same with the 2S again and no scroll issues so something is definitely wrong with this mouse. Put in for a defective item replacement and hope it's just this one mouse. Will update this review if the replacement fixes the problem.Edit: I forgot to mention that I bought this updated MX Master 3 hoping the macOS bluetooth jittery cursor issues would be fixed as there are known bluetooth problems with macOS with the MX Master 2S. Sadly they were not fixed and it's still jittery on a Mac.\n\n", "\n\n  Purchased this product after accidentally purchasing the 2S. Amazon listed this product two days later, so I got a chance to compare and contrast the two.Aesthetically the white 2S looked much better on my white desk, in fact it was a perfect match. The light grey version of the 3, leaves me wishing that they released a white version with silver accents instead (the silver portions is akin to the silver of MacBooks or other Apple devices, the light grey portion does not match Apple devices). But considering the button placement of the 2S, I\u2019d rather deal with the undesirable color of the 3, than stress my thumb to use the forward and back buttons on the 2S.Which leads to the ergonomics.The 3 has significantly better placement for my larger than average hands (my hands require an L or XL glove, due to finger length, I\u2019m 6\u20191\u201d with basketball player hands). On the 2S it required pulling my thumb so far back, that it initially felt like my thumb was going to dislocate (maybe if I used the joint of my thumb to press it, it would\u2019ve been easier, but the buttons being stacked on top of each other on the 2S made it a bit difficult to target the button with the joint of my large fingers; using the tip my thumb was easier). On the 3 that isn\u2019t a problem. However, the 3 causes the horizontal scroll wheel to be so high, that it also causes my thumb to be in an awkward / uncomfortable position when trying to scroll horizontally. Fortunately, I don\u2019t require scrolling horizontally that often, and after awhile maybe I\u2019ll learn better hand placement. Probably would\u2019ve been better to put those buttons almost directly where the thumb rests (only slightly above), instead of completely above the thumb (therefore the horizontal scroll wheel could\u2019ve been lower). It\u2019s usable, just know it might cause some initial discomfort for large hands / long fingers.The vertical scroll wheel is great. Feels much better than the scroll wheel on the 2S, but it may take some fiddling with the Logitech Options program to get it to automatically switch to free scrolling based on your desired speed. The default setting switches it too easily, and the jump from ratcheted scrolling to free scrolling speed is significant. You might find yourself wanting to just scroll a few lines faster, and then suddenly you\u2019re all the way at the bottom of a webpage.Also, upon the release Youtubers began posting their reviews, and many of them indicated that the scroll wheel is silent. That is not actually the case. In comparison to the 2S, it\u2019s relatively silent (significantly more silent), in free scrolling mode it\u2019s actually silent, but in ratcheting mode it can be clearly heard. Personally I find that pleasant, I was disappointed hearing what I basically interpreted as the mouse not giving any auditory feedback, but it indeed can be heard it\u2019s just much lower than the MX mice before, and the feel of it is much more pleasant.Lastly, the software.The Logitech Options program failed to install on a Mac. It just hangs on the first try. This happened when I initially installed the software for the 2S. I had to force quit the install, uninstall the program, and then reinstall it. Upon installing it the second time, the install completed fine. When I eventually received the 3, the program would not recognize the new mouse and I couldn\u2019t get it to register as a new device. I also could not remove the previous 2S, to be able to install the 3. So I then had to uninstall the program again, and upon installing the newer version that they just released, the program hung on the first install process again. So, I had to uninstall it for a third time, and reinstall it again. When the program reinstalled it showed no devices and I was able to add the 3 as a new device, registering it correctly.Perhaps this issue is because I am an Apple Developer, and am using a Developer Beta of macOS. Or maybe it\u2019s just Logitech going through growing pains they\u2019ll resolve later. But if you encounter an issue like me, know that it can be solved, it will just take patience.The one thing I haven\u2019t figured out yet is, when installing the custom profiles so that the mouse switches behavior based on the application you are using ... I am not able to install the profile for Photoshop. The Safari, Chrome, and other profiles installed without a problem, only Photoshop did not. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Photoshop, no dice. I dread the thought of attempting to uninstall and reinstall Logitech Options again. Maybe I\u2019ll try that next month when enough time has passed, and will update this review accordingly.Those quirks aside, I can honestly say that the 3 is a worthy upgrade. I\u2019ll keep it until they release it in white or the 3s / 4, whichever comes first. But for now I\u2019m as satisfied as I can be, and recommend it.\n\n", "\n\n  The MX Master 2s was a fantastic mouse, but I had two complaints about it: 1, It used Micro USB instead of Type C and 2, the thumb wheel and navigation buttons were hard to use.The MX Master 3 fixes both those problems. The thumb wheel now has a very high quality feel to it and is very easy to spin around, and they've moved the navigation buttons lower down to make them easier to press with your thumb. The main scrollwheel has also been made quieter, and somehow even more fun to use.As before, this mouse works on pretty much all surfaces, can connect to 3 devices, and can connect by either bluetooth or a USB dongle. I've had no issues using it on both a Mac and PC.Logitech claims a battery life of 70 days, and while I obviously haven't been able to test that out yet, if the MX Master 2S is anything to go by, you can expect great battery life on this mouse too.\n\n", "\n\n  There is no question the placement of the back and forward buttons has been improved as well as the horizontal scrolling wheel. The tracking also seems more precise. The gesture button is also vastly improved and now has an actual physical button.  Before there was nothing.However, the deal breaker for me is the shape of the mouse.  On the MX Master, I can rest my 2nd and 3rd fingers on the mouse buttons, which have a glossy finish. There is very little effort involved in clicking the buttons.  The MX3 has a lower profile than the MX Master. The shape has been radically changed. On the MX3 there is a gap between where my fingers sit and the mouse buttons. My fingers no longer rest on the mouse buttons.  The  physical mouse buttons on the MX Master, besides sitting higher, are about 5/8\" cm longer in length and that also makes a perceptible difference. The MX buttons are also a bit wider, which makes them easier to press.  Essentially, it's more fatiguing to my 2nd and 3rd fingers to hold them just above the buttons on the MX3. The surface of the MX3 mouse buttons is also matte which creates a bit more friction. The angle of the buttons is also different. The bottom line is that MX3, while sleeker and more polished in design,  is much less comfortable (to me) and requires more effort and dexterity to use. Those with different size hands might find their results are different from mine. I'm also 67 and might not have the same dexterity and strength as a younger person. The ergonomics are just not there for me.\n\n", "\n\n  Very disappointed, he mouse can even compared with the Apple Magic Mouse. The scroll is lagging and jittering. Do try it if you want to use with Mac.\n\n", "\n\n  Sadly after all these years, the MX Revolution is still the best mouse ever made. I also appreciate the click button responsiveness of the Performance MX mouse. The MX Master series (1,2 and now 3) all have click buttons that are not springy/clicky/responsive (however you want to put it) enough. After about an hour of use, the click buttons become mushy, in that the don't travel and rebound well enough to make using it a snappy and enjoyable experience. Cheap parts? Inability to listen to customer feedback?  I don't know. I'm just disappointed. If anybody knows a workaround to make the click buttons more responsive, I'd love to hear it.\n\n", "\n\n  I was really looking forward to enjoying this mouse. I've used a 2S for about a year now, and it had several drawbacks that I thought this mouse would correct. Unfortunately, this mouse is rather underwhelming.Positives:- Forward/back buttons are actually in a reasonable, usable position now. Your thumb doesn't need to reach an ungodly angle and search for the button you want to hit- Horizontal scroll wheel also has a better feel, it's a bit larger which makes it more accessible and easy to control.- Middle scroll wheel is very smooth, and much quieter, which is a huge plus to the loud ratcheting sound of the 2S- You can now have app-specific settings, which is a nice feature. Although I see no reason why they can't just roll out an update to allow this on the 2S as well.Negatives:- They've made this mouse even smaller, somehow. The shape is very unnatural to anyone with a slightly larger than average hand. My first knuckle sits behind the \"saddle\" of the mouse, where the palm should be, causing constant repositioning. I had a friend with smaller hands try it out for a bit, and he seemed to like the ergonomics. But for anyone with a slightly larger hand size, this mouse feels very uncomfortable. The rear portion of the mouse no longer sits nicely in the palm of your hand, and forces you to have more of a tilt, but there's not enough of the mouse there to support the angle.- The thumb gesture button feels strange. It's too far back for my thumb to push naturally, and the response on it is way less tactile than the 2S, making it difficult to be confident in your presses. This is a huge drawback for me, as I use the gesture button frequently.- Scrolling quickly can be unresponsive at times. If you are rapidly scrolling up and down a page or app, some of the movements aren't registered, causing you to go further up or down than you intended. Also, if you are hovered over an app and begin to scroll, it takes 1-2 seconds for the scrolling to begin. This is purely functionality of the device, so I don't know if it's specific to the one I received or not, but this is a significant step backwards.- When customizing the gesture button to your own commands, there is no option for \"task view\". You must manually program the keystroke (Win + Tab) for the gesture you want. I'm sure this is just a Logitech Options issue which will be updated, but something this obvious shouldn't be missed.Overall, this mouse doesn't have enough improvements to outweigh all the drawbacks they've created. I'm not sure if the ergonomics are geared towards a different demographic, but is seems as if I need an XL version of this mouse.

And this time with real improvements with the design.So the last 2 where incredibly similar to each other.  The only difference between the 2 being a better performing sensor, and more software functionality.  But otherwise identical ergonomically and base function.Now, the 3rd version offers some real improvements.  While offering the same sensor and software improvements of the last gen, you now have a real change to its ergonomics and the scroll wheel is just better.I used to have a problem with my index finger sticking out past the mouse due to the arrow head like design.  but now this mouse is a bit more asymetrical with a slightly longer index button.  And the scroll wheel and buttons around your thumb are just way better positioned.  I can actually use them without straining myself.  And the thumb scroll performs so much better now.  Much more smother and responsive.And finally the real claim to fame, the new scroll wheel.  It is the softest, gentlist, most responsive scroll wheel i have ever used.  The old gens you would really feel the different notches, and you feel like your have to force it to grind past before it just lets go and starts to slide freely.  But this magnetic version just feels smoother.  It doesnt feel like physical notches, more but like the wheel is just stopping itself.  Its kind of like if you passed to magnets close together with the same poles.  You will feel that force as they get closer together, and that release when you go past it.  But just repeated over and over.  And when you flick that wheel, the magnets disappears and it just flows.  I hope i did a good job explaining it.  It just feels better than the last gen.  And the last gen was already my absolute favorite scroll wheel.If you had the previous versions, i honestly believe that this is worth the upgrade.  You will like this one so much more.\n\n", "\n\n  WHY Logitech!  Why? Lets finally go FULL USB C not this half butt effort. I want to see a full butt USB C effort.\n\n", "\n\n  The scroll wheel is awesome.

All seems fine except the scrolling with the scroll wheel. After about 3 turns of the wheel the web pages don't scroll consistently (tried multiple browsers) as if the wheel turning is not being detected internally properly. I tried the same with the 2S again and no scroll issues so something is definitely wrong with this mouse. Put in for a defective item replacement and hope it's just this one mouse. Will update this review if the replacement fixes the problem.Edit: I forgot to mention that I bought this updated MX Master 3 hoping the macOS bluetooth jittery cursor issues would be fixed as there are known bluetooth problems with macOS with the MX Master 2S. Sadly they were not fixed and it's still jittery on a Mac.\n\n", "\n\n  Purchased this product after accidentally purchasing the 2S. Amazon listed this product two days later, so I got a chance to compare and contrast the two.Aesthetically the white 2S looked much better on my white desk, in fact it was a perfect match. The light grey version of the 3, leaves me wishing that they released a white version with silver accents instead (the silver portions is akin to the silver of MacBooks or other Apple devices, the light grey portion does not match Apple devices). But considering the button placement of the 2S, I\u2019d rather deal with the undesirable color of the 3, than stress my thumb to use the forward and back buttons on the 2S.Which leads to the ergonomics.The 3 has significantly better placement for my larger than average hands (my hands require an L or XL glove, due to finger length, I\u2019m 6\u20191\u201d with basketball player hands). On the 2S it required pulling my thumb so far back, that it initially felt like my thumb was going to dislocate (maybe if I used the joint of my thumb to press it, it would\u2019ve been easier, but the buttons being stacked on top of each other on the 2S made it a bit difficult to target the button with the joint of my large fingers; using the tip my thumb was easier). On the 3 that isn\u2019t a problem. However, the 3 causes the horizontal scroll wheel to be so high, that it also causes my thumb to be in an awkward / uncomfortable position when trying to scroll horizontally. Fortunately, I don\u2019t require scrolling horizontally that often, and after awhile maybe I\u2019ll learn better hand placement. Probably would\u2019ve been better to put those buttons almost directly where the thumb rests (only slightly above), instead of completely above the thumb (therefore the horizontal scroll wheel could\u2019ve been lower). It\u2019s usable, just know it might cause some initial discomfort for large hands / long fingers.The vertical scroll wheel is great. Feels much better than the scroll wheel on the 2S, but it may take some fiddling with the Logitech Options program to get it to automatically switch to free scrolling based on your desired speed. The default setting switches it too easily, and the jump from ratcheted scrolling to free scrolling speed is significant. You might find yourself wanting to just scroll a few lines faster, and then suddenly you\u2019re all the way at the bottom of a webpage.Also, upon the release Youtubers began posting their reviews, and many of them indicated that the scroll wheel is silent. That is not actually the case. In comparison to the 2S, it\u2019s relatively silent (significantly more silent), in free scrolling mode it\u2019s actually silent, but in ratcheting mode it can be clearly heard. Personally I find that pleasant, I was disappointed hearing what I basically interpreted as the mouse not giving any auditory feedback, but it indeed can be heard it\u2019s just much lower than the MX mice before, and the feel of it is much more pleasant.Lastly, the software.The Logitech Options program failed to install on a Mac. It just hangs on the first try. This happened when I initially installed the software for the 2S. I had to force quit the install, uninstall the program, and then reinstall it. Upon installing it the second time, the install completed fine. When I eventually received the 3, the program would not recognize the new mouse and I couldn\u2019t get it to register as a new device. I also could not remove the previous 2S, to be able to install the 3. So I then had to uninstall the program again, and upon installing the newer version that they just released, the program hung on the first install process again. So, I had to uninstall it for a third time, and reinstall it again. When the program reinstalled it showed no devices and I was able to add the 3 as a new device, registering it correctly.Perhaps this issue is because I am an Apple Developer, and am using a Developer Beta of macOS. Or maybe it\u2019s just Logitech going through growing pains they\u2019ll resolve later. But if you encounter an issue like me, know that it can be solved, it will just take patience.The one thing I haven\u2019t figured out yet is, when installing the custom profiles so that the mouse switches behavior based on the application you are using ... I am not able to install the profile for Photoshop. The Safari, Chrome, and other profiles installed without a problem, only Photoshop did not. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Photoshop, no dice. I dread the thought of attempting to uninstall and reinstall Logitech Options again. Maybe I\u2019ll try that next month when enough time has passed, and will update this review accordingly.Those quirks aside, I can honestly say that the 3 is a worthy upgrade. I\u2019ll keep it until they release it in white or the 3s / 4, whichever comes first. But for now I\u2019m as satisfied as I can be, and recommend it.\n\n", "\n\n  The MX Master 2s was a fantastic mouse, but I had two complaints about it: 1, It used Micro USB instead of Type C and 2, the thumb wheel and navigation buttons were hard to use.The MX Master 3 fixes both those problems. The thumb wheel now has a very high quality feel to it and is very easy to spin around, and they've moved the navigation buttons lower down to make them easier to press with your thumb. The main scrollwheel has also been made quieter, and somehow even more fun to use.As before, this mouse works on pretty much all surfaces, can connect to 3 devices, and can connect by either bluetooth or a USB dongle. I've had no issues using it on both a Mac and PC.Logitech claims a battery life of 70 days, and while I obviously haven't been able to test that out yet, if the MX Master 2S is anything to go by, you can expect great battery life on this mouse too.\n\n", "\n\n  There is no question the placement of the back and forward buttons has been improved as well as the horizontal scrolling wheel. The tracking also seems more precise. The gesture button is also vastly improved and now has an actual physical button.  Before there was nothing.However, the deal breaker for me is the shape of the mouse.  On the MX Master, I can rest my 2nd and 3rd fingers on the mouse buttons, which have a glossy finish. There is very little effort involved in clicking the buttons.  The MX3 has a lower profile than the MX Master. The shape has been radically changed. On the MX3 there is a gap between where my fingers sit and the mouse buttons. My fingers no longer rest on the mouse buttons.  The  physical mouse buttons on the MX Master, besides sitting higher, are about 5/8\" cm longer in length and that also makes a perceptible difference. The MX buttons are also a bit wider, which makes them easier to press.  Essentially, it's more fatiguing to my 2nd and 3rd fingers to hold them just above the buttons on the MX3. The surface of the MX3 mouse buttons is also matte which creates a bit more friction. The angle of the buttons is also different. The bottom line is that MX3, while sleeker and more polished in design,  is much less comfortable (to me) and requires more effort and dexterity to use. Those with different size hands might find their results are different from mine. I'm also 67 and might not have the same dexterity and strength as a younger person. The ergonomics are just not there for me.\n\n", "\n\n  Very disappointed, he mouse can even compared with the Apple Magic Mouse. The scroll is lagging and jittering. Do try it if you want to use with Mac.\n\n", "\n\n  Sadly after all these years, the MX Revolution is still the best mouse ever made. I also appreciate the click button responsiveness of the Performance MX mouse. The MX Master series (1,2 and now 3) all have click buttons that are not springy/clicky/responsive (however you want to put it) enough. After about an hour of use, the click buttons become mushy, in that the don't travel and rebound well enough to make using it a snappy and enjoyable experience. Cheap parts? Inability to listen to customer feedback?  I don't know. I'm just disappointed. If anybody knows a workaround to make the click buttons more responsive, I'd love to hear it.\n\n", "\n\n  I was really looking forward to enjoying this mouse. I've used a 2S for about a year now, and it had several drawbacks that I thought this mouse would correct. Unfortunately, this mouse is rather underwhelming.Positives:- Forward/back buttons are actually in a reasonable, usable position now. Your thumb doesn't need to reach an ungodly angle and search for the button you want to hit- Horizontal scroll wheel also has a better feel, it's a bit larger which makes it more accessible and easy to control.- Middle scroll wheel is very smooth, and much quieter, which is a huge plus to the loud ratcheting sound of the 2S- You can now have app-specific settings, which is a nice feature. Although I see no reason why they can't just roll out an update to allow this on the 2S as well.Negatives:- They've made this mouse even smaller, somehow. The shape is very unnatural to anyone with a slightly larger than average hand. My first knuckle sits behind the \"saddle\" of the mouse, where the palm should be, causing constant repositioning. I had a friend with smaller hands try it out for a bit, and he seemed to like the ergonomics. But for anyone with a slightly larger hand size, this mouse feels very uncomfortable. The rear portion of the mouse no longer sits nicely in the palm of your hand, and forces you to have more of a tilt, but there's not enough of the mouse there to support the angle.- The thumb gesture button feels strange. It's too far back for my thumb to push naturally, and the response on it is way less tactile than the 2S, making it difficult to be confident in your presses. This is a huge drawback for me, as I use the gesture button frequently.- Scrolling quickly can be unresponsive at times. If you are rapidly scrolling up and down a page or app, some of the movements aren't registered, causing you to go further up or down than you intended. Also, if you are hovered over an app and begin to scroll, it takes 1-2 seconds for the scrolling to begin. This is purely functionality of the device, so I don't know if it's specific to the one I received or not, but this is a significant step backwards.- When customizing the gesture button to your own commands, there is no option for \"task view\". You must manually program the keystroke (Win + Tab) for the gesture you want. I'm sure this is just a Logitech Options issue which will be updated, but something this obvious shouldn't be missed.Overall, this mouse doesn't have enough improvements to outweigh all the drawbacks they've created. I'm not sure if the ergonomics are geared towards a different demographic, but is seems as if I need an XL version of this mouse. I'm going to try it out for another week to see if I can adjust to it, but at this point it looks like I'm going to return, and just get another 2S.\n\n", "\n\n  The best Mx Master yet.

On the 2S it required pulling my thumb so far back, that it initially felt like my thumb was going to dislocate (maybe if I used the joint of my thumb to press it, it would\u2019ve been easier, but the buttons being stacked on top of each other on the 2S made it a bit difficult to target the button with the joint of my large fingers; using the tip my thumb was easier). On the 3 that isn\u2019t a problem. However, the 3 causes the horizontal scroll wheel to be so high, that it also causes my thumb to be in an awkward / uncomfortable position when trying to scroll horizontally. Fortunately, I don\u2019t require scrolling horizontally that often, and after awhile maybe I\u2019ll learn better hand placement. Probably would\u2019ve been better to put those buttons almost directly where the thumb rests (only slightly above), instead of completely above the thumb (therefore the horizontal scroll wheel could\u2019ve been lower). It\u2019s usable, just know it might cause some initial discomfort for large hands / long fingers.The vertical scroll wheel is great. Feels much better than the scroll wheel on the 2S, but it may take some fiddling with the Logitech Options program to get it to automatically switch to free scrolling based on your desired speed. The default setting switches it too easily, and the jump from ratcheted scrolling to free scrolling speed is significant. You might find yourself wanting to just scroll a few lines faster, and then suddenly you\u2019re all the way at the bottom of a webpage.Also, upon the release Youtubers began posting their reviews, and many of them indicated that the scroll wheel is silent. That is not actually the case. In comparison to the 2S, it\u2019s relatively silent (significantly more silent), in free scrolling mode it\u2019s actually silent, but in ratcheting mode it can be clearly heard. Personally I find that pleasant, I was disappointed hearing what I basically interpreted as the mouse not giving any auditory feedback, but it indeed can be heard it\u2019s just much lower than the MX mice before, and the feel of it is much more pleasant.Lastly, the software.The Logitech Options program failed to install on a Mac. It just hangs on the first try. This happened when I initially installed the software for the 2S. I had to force quit the install, uninstall the program, and then reinstall it. Upon installing it the second time, the install completed fine. When I eventually received the 3, the program would not recognize the new mouse and I couldn\u2019t get it to register as a new device. I also could not remove the previous 2S, to be able to install the 3. So I then had to uninstall the program again, and upon installing the newer version that they just released, the program hung on the first install process again. So, I had to uninstall it for a third time, and reinstall it again. When the program reinstalled it showed no devices and I was able to add the 3 as a new device, registering it correctly.Perhaps this issue is because I am an Apple Developer, and am using a Developer Beta of macOS. Or maybe it\u2019s just Logitech going through growing pains they\u2019ll resolve later. But if you encounter an issue like me, know that it can be solved, it will just take patience.The one thing I haven\u2019t figured out yet is, when installing the custom profiles so that the mouse switches behavior based on the application you are using ... I am not able to install the profile for Photoshop. The Safari, Chrome, and other profiles installed without a problem, only Photoshop did not. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Photoshop, no dice. I dread the thought of attempting to uninstall and reinstall Logitech Options again. Maybe I\u2019ll try that next month when enough time has passed, and will update this review accordingly.Those quirks aside, I can honestly say that the 3 is a worthy upgrade. I\u2019ll keep it until they release it in white or the 3s / 4, whichever comes first. But for now I\u2019m as satisfied as I can be, and recommend it.\n\n", "\n\n  The MX Master 2s was a fantastic mouse, but I had two complaints about it: 1, It used Micro USB instead of Type C and 2, the thumb wheel and navigation buttons were hard to use.The MX Master 3 fixes both those problems. The thumb wheel now has a very high quality feel to it and is very easy to spin around, and they've moved the navigation buttons lower down to make them easier to press with your thumb. The main scrollwheel has also been made quieter, and somehow even more fun to use.As before, this mouse works on pretty much all surfaces, can connect to 3 devices, and can connect by either bluetooth or a USB dongle. I've had no issues using it on both a Mac and PC.Logitech claims a battery life of 70 days, and while I obviously haven't been able to test that out yet, if the MX Master 2S is anything to go by, you can expect great battery life on this mouse too.\n\n", "\n\n  There is no question the placement of the back and forward buttons has been improved as well as the horizontal scrolling wheel. The tracking also seems more precise. The gesture button is also vastly improved and now has an actual physical button.  Before there was nothing.However, the deal breaker for me is the shape of the mouse.  On the MX Master, I can rest my 2nd and 3rd fingers on the mouse buttons, which have a glossy finish. There is very little effort involved in clicking the buttons.  The MX3 has a lower profile than the MX Master. The shape has been radically changed. On the MX3 there is a gap between where my fingers sit and the mouse buttons. My fingers no longer rest on the mouse buttons.  The  physical mouse buttons on the MX Master, besides sitting higher, are about 5/8\" cm longer in length and that also makes a perceptible difference. The MX buttons are also a bit wider, which makes them easier to press.  Essentially, it's more fatiguing to my 2nd and 3rd fingers to hold them just above the buttons on the MX3. The surface of the MX3 mouse buttons is also matte which creates a bit more friction. The angle of the buttons is also different. The bottom line is that MX3, while sleeker and more polished in design,  is much less comfortable (to me) and requires more effort and dexterity to use. Those with different size hands might find their results are different from mine. I'm also 67 and might not have the same dexterity and strength as a younger person. The ergonomics are just not there for me.\n\n", "\n\n  Very disappointed, he mouse can even compared with the Apple Magic Mouse. The scroll is lagging and jittering. Do try it if you want to use with Mac.\n\n", "\n\n  Sadly after all these years, the MX Revolution is still the best mouse ever made. I also appreciate the click button responsiveness of the Performance MX mouse. The MX Master series (1,2 and now 3) all have click buttons that are not springy/clicky/responsive (however you want to put it) enough. After about an hour of use, the click buttons become mushy, in that the don't travel and rebound well enough to make using it a snappy and enjoyable experience. Cheap parts? Inability to listen to customer feedback?  I don't know. I'm just disappointed. If anybody knows a workaround to make the click buttons more responsive, I'd love to hear it.\n\n", "\n\n  I was really looking forward to enjoying this mouse. I've used a 2S for about a year now, and it had several drawbacks that I thought this mouse would correct. Unfortunately, this mouse is rather underwhelming.Positives:- Forward/back buttons are actually in a reasonable, usable position now. Your thumb doesn't need to reach an ungodly angle and search for the button you want to hit- Horizontal scroll wheel also has a better feel, it's a bit larger which makes it more accessible and easy to control.- Middle scroll wheel is very smooth, and much quieter, which is a huge plus to the loud ratcheting sound of the 2S- You can now have app-specific settings, which is a nice feature. Although I see no reason why they can't just roll out an update to allow this on the 2S as well.Negatives:- They've made this mouse even smaller, somehow. The shape is very unnatural to anyone with a slightly larger than average hand. My first knuckle sits behind the \"saddle\" of the mouse, where the palm should be, causing constant repositioning. I had a friend with smaller hands try it out for a bit, and he seemed to like the ergonomics. But for anyone with a slightly larger hand size, this mouse feels very uncomfortable. The rear portion of the mouse no longer sits nicely in the palm of your hand, and forces you to have more of a tilt, but there's not enough of the mouse there to support the angle.- The thumb gesture button feels strange. It's too far back for my thumb to push naturally, and the response on it is way less tactile than the 2S, making it difficult to be confident in your presses. This is a huge drawback for me, as I use the gesture button frequently.- Scrolling quickly can be unresponsive at times. If you are rapidly scrolling up and down a page or app, some of the movements aren't registered, causing you to go further up or down than you intended. Also, if you are hovered over an app and begin to scroll, it takes 1-2 seconds for the scrolling to begin. This is purely functionality of the device, so I don't know if it's specific to the one I received or not, but this is a significant step backwards.- When customizing the gesture button to your own commands, there is no option for \"task view\". You must manually program the keystroke (Win + Tab) for the gesture you want. I'm sure this is just a Logitech Options issue which will be updated, but something this obvious shouldn't be missed.Overall, this mouse doesn't have enough improvements to outweigh all the drawbacks they've created. I'm not sure if the ergonomics are geared towards a different demographic, but is seems as if I need an XL version of this mouse. I'm going to try it out for another week to see if I can adjust to it, but at this point it looks like I'm going to return, and just get another 2S.\n\n", "\n\n  The best Mx Master yet.  And this time with real improvements with the design.So the last 2 where incredibly similar to each other.  The only difference between the 2 being a better performing sensor, and more software functionality.  But otherwise identical ergonomically and base function.Now, the 3rd version offers some real improvements.  While offering the same sensor and software improvements of the last gen, you now have a real change to its ergonomics and the scroll wheel is just better.I used to have a problem with my index finger sticking out past the mouse due to the arrow head like design.  but now this mouse is a bit more asymetrical with a slightly longer index button.  And the scroll wheel and buttons around your thumb are just way better positioned.  I can actually use them without straining myself.  And the thumb scroll performs so much better now.  Much more smother and responsive.And finally the real claim to fame, the new scroll wheel.  It is the softest, gentlist, most responsive scroll wheel i have ever used.  The old gens you would really feel the different notches, and you feel like your have to force it to grind past before it just lets go and starts to slide freely.  But this magnetic version just feels smoother.  It doesnt feel like physical notches, more but like the wheel is just stopping itself.  Its kind of like if you passed to magnets close together with the same poles.  You will feel that force as they get closer together, and that release when you go past it.  But just repeated over and over.  And when you flick that wheel, the magnets disappears and it just flows.  I hope i did a good job explaining it.  It just feels better than the last gen.  And the last gen was already my absolute favorite scroll wheel.If you had the previous versions, i honestly believe that this is worth the upgrade.  You will like this one so much more.\n\n", "\n\n  It is very pleasant having a nice clean new keyboard to use. I feel that it was well worth the purchase price. I do not do any fancy typing.
